    "title": "Perceived service qualityâ€™s effect on patient loyalty through patient attitude within the context of traditional Chinese medicine",
    "abstract": "Drawing on a sample of 245 patients from a tertiary general hospital in China, we examine the effect of perceived service quality of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on patient loyalty. At the same time, both the mediating effect of patient attitude and the moderating effect of familiarity are tested. We find that perceived service quality of TCM has a positive effect on patient loyalty and this relationship is mediated by patient attitude. We also find that moderating effect of patient familiarity with TCM is not supported by the study. Finally, implications for management theory and practice are discussed.",
