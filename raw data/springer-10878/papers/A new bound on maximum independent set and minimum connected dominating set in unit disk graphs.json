    "title": "A new bound on maximum independent set and minimum connected dominating set in unit disk graphs",
    "abstract": "It is a conjecture that in any unit disk graph $$G$$ , $$\\alpha (G) \\le 3 \\cdot \\gamma _c(G) + 3$$ where $$\\alpha (G)$$ is the size of the maximum independent set in $$G$$ and $$\\gamma _c(G)$$ is the size of minimum connected dominating set in $$G$$ . In this paper, we show that in any unit disk graph $$G$$ , $$\\alpha (G) \\le 3.399 \\cdot \\gamma _c(G) + 4.874$$ . Currently, this is the best-known bound.",
