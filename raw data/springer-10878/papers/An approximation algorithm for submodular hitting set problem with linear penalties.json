    "title": "An approximation algorithm for submodular hitting set problem with linear penalties",
    "abstract": "The hitting set problem is a generalization of the vertex cover problem to hypergraphs. Xu et al. (Theor Comput Sci 630:117–125, 2016) presented a primal-dual algorithm for the submodular vertex cover problem with linear/submodular penalties. Motivated by their work, we study the submodular hitting set problem with linear penalties (SHSLP). The goal of the SHSLP is to select a vertex subset in the hypergraph to cover some hyperedges and penalize the uncovered ones such that the total cost of covering and penalty is minimized. Based on the primal-dual scheme, we obtain a k-approximation algorithm for the SHSLP, where k is the maximum number of vertices in all hyperedges.",
