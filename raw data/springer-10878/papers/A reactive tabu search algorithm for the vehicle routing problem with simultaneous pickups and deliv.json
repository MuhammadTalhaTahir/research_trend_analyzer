    "title": "A reactive tabu search algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries",
    "abstract": "The vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries (VRPPD) extends the vehicle routing problem (VRP) by allowing customers to both send and receive goods. The main difficulty of the problem is that the load of vehicles is fluctuating rather than decreasing as in the VRP. We design a reactive tabu search metaheuristic that can check feasibility of proposed moves quickly and reacts to repetitions to guide the search. Several new best solutions are found for benchmark problems.",
