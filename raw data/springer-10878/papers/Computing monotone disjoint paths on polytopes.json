    "title": "Computing monotone disjoint paths on polytopes",
    "abstract": "The Holt-Klee Condition states that there exist at least d vertex-disjoint strictly monotone paths from the source to the sink of a polytopal digraph consisting of the set of vertices and arcs of a polytope P directed by a linear objective function in general position. The study of paths on polytopal digraphs stems from a long standing problem, that of designing a polynomial-time pivot method, or proving none exists. To study disjoint paths it would be useful to have a tool to compute them. Without explicitly computing the digraph we develop an algorithm to compute a maximum cardinality set of source to sink paths in a polytope, even in the presence of degeneracy. The algorithm uses a combination of networks flows, the simplex method, and reverse search. An implementation is available.",
