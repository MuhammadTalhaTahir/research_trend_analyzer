    "title": "The Minimal Spanning Tree Preservation Approaches for DNA Multiple Sequence Alignment and Evolutionary Tree Construction",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new criterion, namely the minimal spanning tree preservation approach, for both of the DNA multiple sequence alignment and the construction of evolutionary trees. It is our aim to keep the proximity information among the sequences or species via our approach. The basic idea behind this approach is that those distances among species which are close to one another are more informative than the others.",
