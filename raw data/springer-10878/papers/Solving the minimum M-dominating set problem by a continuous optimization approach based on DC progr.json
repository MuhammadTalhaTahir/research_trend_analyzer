    "title": "Solving the minimum M-dominating set problem by a continuous optimization approach based on DC programming and DCA",
    "abstract": "We propose a new optimization approach based on DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DCA (DC Algorithm) to the so-called Minimum M-Dominating Set problem in graphs. This problem is beforehand re-casted as a polyhedral DC program with the help of exact penalty in DC programming. The related DCA is original and computer efficient because it consists of solving a few linear programs and converges after a finite number of iterations to an integer solution while working in a continuous domain. Numerical simulations show the efficiency and robustness of DCA and its superiority with respect to standard methods.",
