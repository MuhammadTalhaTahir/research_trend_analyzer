    "title": "Edge-colouring of joins of regular graphs, I",
    "abstract": "We prove that the edges of every even graph G=G 1+G 2 that is the join of two regular graphs G i =(V i ,E i ) can be coloured with Δ(G) colours, whenever Δ(G)=Δ(G 2)+|V 1|. The proof of this result yields a combinatorial algorithm to optimally colour the edges of this type of graphs.",
