    "title": "Emergency medical center location problem with people evacuation solved by extended TODIM and objective programming",
    "abstract": "This study aims to decide the location of emergency medical centers and the evacuation of survivors after a disaster happened. An extended interactive multi-criteria decision making method (TODIM) with interval 2-tuple linguistic variables is proposed to evaluate the potential locations of the emergency medical centers. A bi-objective mixed-integer programming is then established to determine the final locations and the evacuation plan based on previous evaluations. A real case of an earthquake in Wenchuan, China in 2008 is analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",
