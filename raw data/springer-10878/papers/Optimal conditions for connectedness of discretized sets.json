    "title": "Optimal conditions for connectedness of discretized sets",
    "abstract": "An offset discretization of a set $$X \\subset {\\mathbb {R}}^n$$ is obtained by taking the integer points inside a closed neighborhood of X of a certain radius. In this work we determine a minimum threshold for the offset radius, beyond which the discretization of an arbitrary (possibly disconnected) set is always connected. The obtained results hold for a broad class of disconnected subsets of $${\\mathbb {R}}^n$$ and generalize several previous results. We also extend our results to infinite discretizations of unbounded subsets of $${\\mathbb {R}}^n$$ and consider certain algorithmic aspects. The obtained results can be applied to component topology preservation as well as extracting geometric features and connectivity control of very large object discretizations.",
