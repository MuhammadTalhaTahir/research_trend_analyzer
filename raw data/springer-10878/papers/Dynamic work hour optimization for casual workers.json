    "title": "Dynamic work hour optimization for casual workers",
    "abstract": "An original online problem named the work-break problem is proposed to optimize the work hours of casual workers. The algorithm for our problem has to answer for a casual worker about when he should have a break for his efficiency declines with the growing duration of current work period. We consider the online uncertainty of the work efficiency and present a periodic algorithm for the problem. Then our algorithm is proved to be 2-competitive by a novel form of competitive analysis.",
