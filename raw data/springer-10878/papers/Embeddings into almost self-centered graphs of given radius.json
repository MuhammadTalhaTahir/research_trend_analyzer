    "abstract": "A graph is almost self-centered (ASC) if all but two of its vertices are central. An almost self-centered graph with radius r is called an r-ASC graph. The r-ASC index $$\\theta _r(G)$$ of a graph G is the minimum number of vertices needed to be added to G such that an r-ASC graph is obtained that contains G as an induced subgraph. It is proved that $$\\theta _r(G)\\le 2r$$ holds for any graph G and any $$r\\ge 2$$ which improves the earlier known bound $$\\theta _r(G)\\le 2r+1$$ . It is further proved that $$\\theta _r(G)\\le 2r-1$$ holds if $$r\\ge 3$$ and G is of order at least 2. The 3-ASC index of complete graphs is determined. It is proved that $$\\theta _3(G)\\in \\{3,4\\}$$ if G has diameter 2 and for several classes of graphs of diameter 2 the exact value of the 3-ASC index is obtained. For instance, if a graph G of diameter 2 does not contain a diametrical triple, then $$\\theta _3(G) = 4$$ . The 3-ASC index of paths of order $$n\\ge 1$$ , cycles of order $$n\\ge 3$$ , and trees of order $$n\\ge 10$$ and diameter $$n-2$$ are also determined, respectively, and several open problems proposed.",
