    "title": "An approximation algorithm for maximum weight budgeted connected set cover",
    "abstract": "This paper studies approximation algorithm for the maximum weight budgeted connected set cover (MWBCSC) problem. Given an element set $$X$$ , a collection of sets $${\\mathcal {S}}\\subseteq 2^X$$ , a weight function $$w$$ on $$X$$ , a cost function $$c$$ on $${\\mathcal {S}}$$ , a connected graph $$G_{\\mathcal {S}}$$ (called communication graph) on vertex set $${\\mathcal {S}}$$ , and a budget $$L$$ , the MWBCSC problem is to select a subcollection $${\\mathcal {S'}}\\subseteq {\\mathcal {S}}$$ such that the cost $$c({\\mathcal {S'}})=\\sum _{S\\in {\\mathcal {S'}}}c(S)\\le L$$ , the subgraph of $$G_{\\mathcal {S}}$$ induced by $${\\mathcal {S'}}$$ is connected, and the total weight of elements covered by $${\\mathcal {S'}}$$ (that is $$\\sum _{x\\in \\bigcup _{S\\in {\\mathcal {S'}}}S}w(x)$$ ) is maximized. We present a polynomial time algorithm for this problem with a natural communication graph that has performance ratio $$O((\\delta +1)\\log n)$$ , where $$\\delta $$ is the maximum degree of graph $$G_{\\mathcal {S}}$$ and $$n$$ is the number of sets in $${\\mathcal {S}}$$ . In particular, if every set has cost at most $$L/2$$ , the performance ratio can be improved to $$O(\\log n)$$ .",
