    "title": "Improved Bounds on Relaxations of a Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of scheduling n jobs withrelease dates on m identical parallel machines to minimize the average completion time of the jobs. We prove that the ratio of the average completion time of the optimal nonpreemptive schedule to that of the optimal preemptive schedule is at most 7/3, improving a bound of $$(3 - \\frac{1}{m})$$ Shmoys and Wein.",
