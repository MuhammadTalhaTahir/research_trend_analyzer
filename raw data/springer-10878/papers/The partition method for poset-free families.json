    "title": "The partition method for poset-free families",
    "abstract": "Given a finite poset P, let ${\\rm La}(n,P)$ denote the largest size of a family of subsets of an n-set that does not contain P as a (weak) subposet. We employ a combinatorial method, using partitions of the collection of all full chains of subsets of the n-set, to give simpler new proofs of the known asymptotic behavior of ${\\rm La}(n,P)$ , as n→∞, when P is the r-fork $\\mathcal {V}_{r}$ , the four-element N poset $\\mathcal {N}$ , and the four-element butterfly-poset $\\mathcal {B}$ .",
