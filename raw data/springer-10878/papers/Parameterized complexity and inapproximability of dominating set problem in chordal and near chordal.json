    "title": "Parameterized complexity and inapproximability ofÂ dominating set problem in chordal and near chordal graphs",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of Dominating Set problem in chordal graphs and near chordal graphs. We show the problem is W[2]-hard and cannot be solved in time n o(k) in chordal and s-chordal (s&gt;3) graphs unless W[1]=FPT. In addition, we obtain inapproximability results for computing a minimum dominating set in chordal and near chordal graphs. Our results prove that unless NP=P, the minimum dominating set in a chordal or s-chordal (s&gt;3) graph cannot be approximated within a ratio of $\\frac{c}{3}\\ln{n}$ in polynomial time, where n is the number of vertices in the graph and 0",
