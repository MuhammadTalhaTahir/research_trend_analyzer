    "title": "2-Distance coloring of planar graphs with girth 5",
    "abstract": "A vertex coloring is said to be 2-distance if any two distinct vertices of distance at most 2 receive different colors. Let G be a planar graph with girth at least 5. In this paper, we prove that G admits a 2-distance coloring with at most $$\\Delta (G)+3$$ colors if $$\\Delta (G)\\ge 339$$ .",
