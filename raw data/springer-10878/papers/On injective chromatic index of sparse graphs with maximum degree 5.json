    "title": "On injective chromatic index of sparse graphs with maximum degree 5",
    "abstract": "A k-edge coloring $$\\varphi $$ of a graph G is injective if $$\\varphi (e_1)\\ne \\varphi (e_3)$$ for any three consecutive edges $$e_1, e_2$$ and $$e_3$$ of a path or a triangle. The injective chromatic index $$\\chi _i'(G)$$ of G is the smallest k such that G admits an injective k-edge coloring. By discharging method, we demonstrate that any graph with maximum degree $$\\Delta \\le 5$$ has $$\\chi _i'(G)\\le 12$$ (resp. 13) if its maximum average degree is less than $$\\frac{20}{7}$$ (resp. 3), which improves the results of Zhu (2023).",
