    "title": "Total coloring of planar graphs without short cycles",
    "abstract": "The total chromatic number of a graph $$G$$ , denoted by $$\\chi ''(G)$$ , is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices and edges of $$G$$ such that no two adjacent or incident elements get the same color. It is known that if a planar graph $$G$$ has maximum degree $$\\Delta (G)\\ge 9$$ , then $$\\chi ''(G)=\\Delta (G)+1$$ . In this paper, it is proved that if $$G$$ is a planar graph with $$\\Delta (G)\\ge 7$$ , and for each vertex $$v$$ , there is an integer $$k_v\\in \\{3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$$ such that there is no $$k_v$$ -cycle which contains $$v$$ , then $$\\chi ''(G)=\\Delta (G)+1$$ .",
