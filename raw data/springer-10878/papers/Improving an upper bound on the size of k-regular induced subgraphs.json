    "title": "Improving an upper bound on the size of k-regular induced subgraphs",
    "abstract": "This paper considers the NP-hard graph problem of determining a maximum cardinality subset of vertices inducing a k-regular subgraph. For any graph&nbsp;G, this maximum will be denoted by&nbsp;α k (G). From a well known Motzkin-Straus result, a&nbsp;relationship is deduced between α k (G) and the independence number&nbsp;α(G). Next, it is proved that the upper bounds υ k (G) introduced in Cardoso et al. (J. Comb. Optim., 14, 455–463, 2007) can easily be computed from υ 0(G), for any positive integer&nbsp;k. This relationship also allows one to present an alternative proof of the Hoffman bound extension introduced in the above paper. The paper continues with the introduction of a new upper bound on α k (G) improving υ k (G). Due to the difficulty of computing this improved bound, two methods are provided for approximating it. Finally, some computational experiments which were performed to compare all bounds studied are reported.",
