    "title": "Optimal st-orientations for plane triangulations",
    "abstract": "For plane triangulations, it has been proved that there exists a plane triangulation G with n vertices such that for any st-orientation of G, the length of the longest directed paths of G in the st-orientation is $\\geq\\lfloor\\frac{2n}{3}\\rfloor$ (Zhang and He in Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol.&nbsp;3383, pp.&nbsp;425â€“430, 2005). In this paper, we prove the bound $\\frac{2n}{3}$ is optimal by showing that every plane triangulation G with n-vertices admits an st-orientation with the length of its longest directed paths bounded by $\\frac{2n}{3}+O(1)$ . In addition, this st-orientation is constructible in linear time. A by-product of this result is that every plane graph G with n vertices admits a visibility representation with height $\\le\\frac{2n}{3}+O(1)$ , constructible in linear time, which is also optimal.",
