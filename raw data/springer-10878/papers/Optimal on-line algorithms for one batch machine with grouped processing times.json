    "title": "Optimal on-line algorithms for one batch machine with grouped processing times",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study on-line scheduling problems on a batch machine with the assumption that all jobs have their processing times in [p, (1+φ)p], where p&gt;0 and $\\phi=(\\sqrt{5}-1)/2$ . Jobs arrive over time. First, we deal with the on-line problem on a bounded batch machine with the objective to minimize makespan. A&nbsp;class of algorithms with competitive ratio $(\\sqrt{5}+1)/2$ are given. Then we consider the scheduling on an unbounded batch machine to minimize the time by which all jobs have been delivered, and provide a class of on-line algorithms with competitive ratio $(\\sqrt{5}+1)/2$ . The two class of algorithms are optimal for the problems studied here.",
