    "title": "An improved approximation algorithm for the shortest link scheduling in wireless networks under SINR and hypergraph models",
    "abstract": "Link scheduling is a fundamental problem in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. In this paper, we focus on the shortest link scheduling (SLS) under Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio and hypergraph models, and propose an approximation algorithm $$SLS_{pc}$$ (A link scheduling algorithm with oblivious power assignment for the shortest link scheduling) with oblivious power assignment for better performance than GOW* proposed by Blough et al. [IEEE/ACM Trans Netw 18(6):1701â€“1712, 2010]. For the average scheduling length of $$SLS_{pc}$$ is 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;m of GOW*, where $$m=\\lfloor \\varDelta _{max}\\cdot p \\rfloor $$ is the expected number of the links in the set V returned by the algorithm HyperMaxLS (Maximal links schedule under hypergraph model) and $$0",
