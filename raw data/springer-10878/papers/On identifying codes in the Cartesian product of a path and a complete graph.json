    "title": "On identifying codes in the Cartesian product of a path and a complete graph",
    "abstract": "Identifying codes in the Cartesian product of a complete graph and a path are considered. After proving a set of sufficient conditions for a set in such a graph to be an identifying code, we then construct minimum identifying codes when the complete graph is of order three or at least five, and when the path is of order at least three.",
