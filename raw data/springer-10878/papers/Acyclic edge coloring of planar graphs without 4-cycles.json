    "title": "Acyclic edge coloring of planar graphs without 4-cycles",
    "abstract": "An acyclic edge coloring of a graph G is a proper edge coloring such that no bichromatic cycles are produced. The acyclic chromatic index a′(G) of G is the smallest integer k such that G has an acyclic edge coloring using k colors. Fiamčik (Math. Slovaca 28:139–145, 1978) and later Alon, Sudakov and Zaks (J.&nbsp;Graph Theory 37:157–167, 2001) conjectured that a′(G)≤Δ+2 for any simple graph G with maximum degree Δ. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture for planar graphs G with Δ≠4 and without 4-cycles.",
