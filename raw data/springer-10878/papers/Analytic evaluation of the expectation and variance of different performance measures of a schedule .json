    "title": "Analytic evaluation of the expectation and variance of different performance measures of a schedule on a single machine under processing time variability",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present closed-form expressions, wherever possible, or devise algorithms otherwise, to determine the expectation and variance of a given schedule on a single machine. We consider a variety of completion time and due date-based objectives. The randomness in the scheduling process is due to variable processing times with known means and variances of jobs and, in some cases, a&nbsp;known underlying processing time distribution. The results that we present in this paper can enable evaluation of a schedule in terms of both the expectation and variance of a performance measure considered, and thereby, aid in obtaining a stable schedule. Additionally, the expressions and algorithms that are presented, can be incorporated in existing scheduling algorithms in order to determine expectation-variance efficient schedules.",
