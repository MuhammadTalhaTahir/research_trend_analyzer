    "title": "Sortabilities of Partition Properties",
    "abstract": "Consider the partition of a set of integers into parts. Various partition properties have been proposed in the literature to facilitate the restriction of the focus of attention to some small class of partitions. Recently, Hwang, Rothblum and Yao defined and studied the sortability of these partition properties as a tool to prove the existence of a partition with such a property in a given family. In this paper we determine the sortability indices of the seven most interesting properties of partitions providing a complete solution to the sortability issue.",
