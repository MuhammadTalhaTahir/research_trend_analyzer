    "title": "Linear time algorithms on mirror trees",
    "abstract": "We address in this paper two problems on mirror graphs. The first is the recognition problem. While it is graph isomorphism complete, we show the analogous problem of recognizing mirror trees is solvable in linear time. The second problem we are tackling in this study is the linear ordering problem on mirror trees with respect to Directed Sum-Cut cost criterion for which a linear time algorithm is exhibited.",
