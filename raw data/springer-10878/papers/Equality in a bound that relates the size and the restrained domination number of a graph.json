    "title": "Equality in a bound that relates the size and the restrained domination number of a graph",
    "abstract": "Let $$G=(V,E)$$ be a graph. A set $$S\\subseteq V$$ is a restrained dominating set if every vertex in $$V-S$$ is adjacent to a vertex in $$S$$ and to a vertex in $$V-S$$ . The restrained domination number of $$G$$ , denoted $$\\gamma _{r}(G)$$ , is the smallest cardinality of a restrained dominating set of $$G$$ . The best possible upper bound $$q(n,k)$$ is established in Joubert (Discrete Appl Math 161:829â€“837, 2013) on the size $$m(G)$$ of a graph $$G$$ with a given order $$n \\ge 5$$ and restrained domination number $$k \\in \\{3, \\ldots , n-2\\}$$ . We extend this result to include the cases $$k=1,2,n$$ , and characterize graphs $$G$$ of order $$n \\ge 1$$ and restrained domination number $$k \\in \\{1,\\dots , n-2,n\\}$$ for which $$m(G)=q(n,k)$$ .",
