    "title": "Single-machine online scheduling of jobs with non-delayed processing constraint",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new environment of online scheduling in which jobs are scheduled under the non-delayed processing (NDP) constraint, where NDP means that the available jobs cannot be delayed for processing when some machine is idle. We study in this paper the single-machine online scheduling to minimize the maximum weighted completion time ( $${\\textit{WC}}_{\\mathrm{max}}$$ ) or the maximum delivery completion time ( $$L_{\\mathrm{max}}$$ ) under the NDP constraint. For the first problem, we establish a lower bound 2 and provide an online algorithm which has a competitive ratio of $$(3+\\sqrt{5})/2\\approx 2.618$$ . We present a 3/2-competitive best possible online algorithm for the second problem.",
