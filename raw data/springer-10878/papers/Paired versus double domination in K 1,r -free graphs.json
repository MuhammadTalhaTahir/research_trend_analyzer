    "title": "Paired versus double domination in K 1,r -free graphs",
    "abstract": "A vertex in G is said to dominate itself and its neighbors. A subset S of vertices is a dominating set if S dominates every vertex of G. A paired-dominating set is a dominating set whose induced subgraph contains a perfect matching. The paired-domination number of a graph G, denoted by γ pr(G), is the minimum cardinality of a paired-dominating set in G. A subset S⊆V(G) is a double dominating set of G if S dominates every vertex of G at least twice. The minimum cardinality of a double dominating set of G is the double domination number γ ×2(G). A claw-free graph is a graph that does not contain K 1,3 as an induced subgraph. Chellali and Haynes (Util. Math. 67:161–171, 2005) showed that for every claw-free graph G, we have γ pr(G)≤γ ×2(G). In this paper we extend this result by showing that for r≥2, if G is a connected graph that does not contain K 1,r as an induced subgraph, then $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{pr}}(G)\\le ( \\frac{2r^{2}-6r+6}{r(r-1)} )\\gamma_{\\times2}(G)$ .",
