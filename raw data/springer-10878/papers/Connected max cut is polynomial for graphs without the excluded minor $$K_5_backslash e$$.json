    "abstract": "Given a graph $$G=(V, E)$$ , a connected cut $$\\delta (U)$$ is the set of edges of E linking all vertices of U to all vertices of $$V\\backslash U$$ such that the induced subgraphs G[U] and $$G[V\\backslash U]$$ are connected. Given a positive weight function w defined on E, the connected maximum cut problem (CMAX CUT) is to find a connected cut $$\\varOmega $$ such that $$w(\\varOmega )$$ is maximum among all connected cuts. CMAX CUT is NP-hard even for planar graphs, and thus for graph without the excluded minor $$K_5$$ . In this paper, we prove that CMAX CUT is polynomial for the class of graphs without the excluded minor $$K_5\\backslash e$$ , denoted by $${\\mathcal {G}}(K_5\\backslash e)$$ . We deduce two quadratic time algorithms: one for the minimum cut problem in $${\\mathcal {G}}(K_5\\backslash e)$$ without computing the maximum flow, and another one for Hamilton cycle problem in the class of graphs without the two excluded minors the prism $$P_6$$ and $$K_{3, 3}$$ . This latter problem is NP-complete for maximal planar graphs.",
