    "title": "An upper bound for neighbor-connectivity of graphs",
    "abstract": "The neighbor-connectivity of a graph G, denoted by $$\\kappa _{NB}(G)$$ , is the least number of vertices such that removing their closed neighborhoods from G results in a graph that is empty, complete, or disconnected. In the paper, we show that for any graph G of order n, $$\\kappa _{NB}(G)\\le \\lceil \\sqrt{2n}\\ \\rceil -2$$ . We pose a conjecture that $$\\kappa _{NB}(G)\\le \\lceil \\sqrt{n}\\ \\rceil -1$$ for a graph G of order n. For supporting it, we show that the conjecture holds for any triangle-free graphs, Cartesian, direct, lexicographic product of any two graphs.",
