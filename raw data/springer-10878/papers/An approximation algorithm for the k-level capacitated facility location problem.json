    "title": "An approximation algorithm for the k-level capacitated facility location problem",
    "abstract": "We consider the k-level capacitated facility location problem (k-CFLP), which is a natural variant of the classical facility location problem and has applications in supply chain management. We obtain the first (combinatorial) approximation algorithm with a performance factor of $k+2+\\sqrt{k^{2}+2k+5}+\\varepsilon$ (ε&gt;0) for this problem.",
