    "title": "An optimal online algorithm for the parallel-batch scheduling with job processing time compatibilities",
    "abstract": "We consider the online (over time) scheduling on a single unbounded parallel-batch machine with job processing time compatibilities to minimize makespan. In the problem, a constant $$\\alpha &gt;0$$ is given in advance. Each job $$J_{j}$$ has a normal processing time $$p_j$$ . Two jobs $$J_i$$ and $$J_j$$ are compatible if $$\\max \\{p_i, p_j\\} \\le (1+\\alpha )\\cdot \\min \\{p_i, p_j\\}$$ . In the problem, mutually compatible jobs can form a batch being processed on the machine. The processing time of a batch is equal to the maximum normal processing time of the jobs in this batch. For this problem, we provide an optimal online algorithm with a competitive ratio of $$1+\\beta _\\alpha $$ , where $$\\beta _\\alpha $$ is the positive root of the equation $$(1+\\alpha )x^{2}+\\alpha x=1+\\alpha $$ .",
