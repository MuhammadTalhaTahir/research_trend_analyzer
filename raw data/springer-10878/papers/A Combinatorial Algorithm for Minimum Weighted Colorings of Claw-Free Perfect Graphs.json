    "title": "A Combinatorial Algorithm for Minimum Weighted Colorings of Claw-Free Perfect Graphs",
    "abstract": "We present an O(n5) combinatorial algorithm for the minimum weighted coloring problem on claw-free perfect graphs, which was posed by Hsu and Nemhauser in 1984. Our algorithm heavily relies on the structural descriptions of claw-free perfect graphs given by Chav√°tal and Sbihi and by Maffray and Reed.",
