    "abstract": "Let $$c_{1},c_{2},\\ldots ,c_{k}$$ be k non-negative integers. A graph G is $$(c_{1},c_{2},\\ldots ,c_{k})$$ -colorable if the vertex set can be partitioned into k sets $$V_{1},V_{2},\\ldots ,V_{k}$$ such that for every $$i,1\\le i\\le k$$ , the subgraph $$G[V_{i}]$$ has maximum degree at most $$c_{i}$$ . Steinberg (Ann Discret Math 55:211–248, 1993) conjectured that every planar graph without 4- and 5-cycles is 3-colorable. Xu and Wang (Sci Math 43:15–24, 2013) conjectured that every planar graph without 4- and 6-cycles is 3-colorable. In this paper, we prove that every planar graph without 3-cycles adjacent to 4-cycles and without 6-cycles is (1,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0)-colorable, which improves the result of Xu and Wang (Sci Math 43:15–24, 2013), who proved that every planar graph without 4- and 6-cycles is (1,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0)-colorable.",
