    "title": "A practical greedy approximation for the directed Steiner tree problem",
    "abstract": "The directed Steiner tree (DST) NP-hard problem asks, considering a directed weighted graph with n nodes and m arcs, a node r called root and a set of k nodes X called terminals, for a minimum cost directed tree rooted at r spanning X. The best known polynomial approximation ratio for DST is a $$O(k^\\varepsilon )$$ -approximation greedy algorithm. However, a much faster k-approximation, returning the shortest paths from r to X, is generally used in practice. We give two new algorithms : a fast k-approximation called Greedy $$_\\text {FLAC}$$ running in $$O(m \\log (n)k + \\min (m, nk)nk^2)$$ and a $$O(\\sqrt{k})$$ -approximation called Greedy $$_\\text {FLAC}^\\triangleright $$ running in $$O(nm + n^2 \\log (n)k +n^2 k^3)$$ . We provide computational results to show that, Greedy $$_\\text {FLAC}$$ rivals in practice with the running time of the fast k-approximation and returns solution with smaller cost in practice.",
