    "title": "Minimum Îµ-equivalent Circuit Size Problem",
    "abstract": "For a Boolean function f given by its truth table (of length $$2^n$$ ) and a parameter s the problem considered is whether there is a Boolean function g $$\\epsilon$$ -equivalent to f, i.e., $$Pr_{x\\in {\\{0,1\\}}^n}\\{g(x) \\ne f(x)\\} \\le \\epsilon$$ , and computed by a circuit of size at most s. In this paper we investigate the complexity of this problem and show that for specific values of $$\\epsilon$$ it is unlikely to be in P/poly. Under the same assumptions we also consider the optimization variant of the problem and prove its inapproximability.",
