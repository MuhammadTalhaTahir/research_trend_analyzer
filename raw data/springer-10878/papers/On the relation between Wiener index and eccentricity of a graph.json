    "title": "On the relation between Wiener index and eccentricity of a graph",
    "abstract": "The relation between the Wiener index W(G) and the eccentricity $$\\varepsilon (G)$$ of a graph G is studied. Lower and upper bounds on W(G) in terms of $$\\varepsilon (G)$$ are proved and extremal graphs characterized. A Nordhaus–Gaddum type result on W(G) involving $$\\varepsilon (G)$$ is given. A sharp upper bound on the Wiener index of a tree in terms of its eccentricity is proved. It is shown that in the class of trees of the same order, the difference $$W(T) - \\varepsilon (T)$$ is minimized on caterpillars. An exact formula for $$W(T) - \\varepsilon (T)$$ in terms of the radius of a tree T is obtained. A lower bound on the eccentricity of a tree in terms of its radius is also given. Two conjectures are proposed. The first asserts that the difference $$W(G) - \\varepsilon (G)$$ does not increase after contracting an edge of G. The second conjecture asserts that the difference between the Wiener index of a graph and its eccentricity is largest on paths.",
