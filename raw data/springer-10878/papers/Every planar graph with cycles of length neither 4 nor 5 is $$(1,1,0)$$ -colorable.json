    "title": "Every planar graph with cycles of length neither 4 nor 5 is $$(1,1,0)$$ -colorable",
    "abstract": "Let $$d_1, d_2,\\dots ,d_k$$ be $$k$$ non-negative integers. A graph $$G$$ is $$(d_1,d_2,\\ldots ,d_k)$$ -colorable, if the vertex set of $$G$$ can be partitioned into subsets $$V_1,V_2,\\ldots ,V_k$$ such that the subgraph $$G[V_i]$$ induced by $$V_i$$ has maximum degree at most $$d_i$$ for $$i=1,2,\\ldots ,k.$$ Let $$\\digamma $$ be the family of planar graphs with cycles of length neither 4 nor 5. Steinberg conjectured that every graph of $$\\digamma $$ is $$(0,0,0)$$ -colorable. In this paper, we prove that every graph of $$\\digamma $$ is $$(1,1,0)$$ -colorable.",
