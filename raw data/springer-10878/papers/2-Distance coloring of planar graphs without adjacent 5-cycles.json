    "title": "2-Distance coloring of planar graphs without adjacent 5-cycles",
    "abstract": "The k-2-distance coloring of graph G is a mapping $$c:V(G)\\rightarrow \\{1,2,\\ldots ,k\\}$$ such that any two vertices at distance at most two from each other get different colors. The 2-distance chromatic number is the smallest integer k such that G has a k-2-distance coloring, denoted by $$\\chi _{2}(G)$$ . In this paper, we prove that every planar graph G without adjacent 5-cycles and $$g(G)\\ge 5$$ and $$\\Delta (G)\\ge 17$$ has $$\\chi _{2}(G)\\le \\Delta +3$$ .",
