    "title": "On the cores of games arising from integer edge covering functions of graphs",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study cooperative games arising from integer edge covering problems on graphs. We introduce two games, a rigid k-edge covering game and its relaxed game, as generalizations of a rigid edge covering game and its relaxed game studied by Liu and Fang (2007). Then we give a characterization of the cores of both games, find relationships between them, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the balancedness of a rigid k-edge covering game and its relaxed game.",
