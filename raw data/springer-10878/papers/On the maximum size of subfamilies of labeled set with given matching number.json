    "title": "On the maximum size of subfamilies of labeled set with given matching number",
    "abstract": "A labeled set is a set of distinct elements with labels assigned to the elements. The family $${{\\mathcal {L}}}^k_{n,p}$$ is the family of labeled k-element subsets of [n] with labels chosen from a set of size p. Two labeled sets are disjoint if they do not share an element that has the same label in both sets. For $$1\\le s\\le p-1$$ , if a family $${\\mathcal {F}}\\subseteq {\\mathcal {L}}^k_{n,p}$$ does not have more than s pairwise disjoint members, then $$|{\\mathcal {F}}|\\le sp^{k-1}\\left( {\\begin{array}{c}n-1\\\\ k-1\\end{array}}\\right) $$ . Furthermore, equality holds if and only if $${\\mathcal {F}}$$ has the form $${{\\mathcal {F}}}_{i,S}$$ , where $${{\\mathcal {F}}}_{i,S}$$ is the family of all members of $${{\\mathcal {L}}}^k_{n,p}$$ containing the element i and using labels only within the s-set S.",
