    "title": "The computational complexity of QoS measures for orchestrations",
    "abstract": "We consider Web services defined by orchestrations in the Orc language and two natural quality of services measures, the number of outputs and a discrete version of the first response time. We analyse first those subfamilies of finite orchestrations in which the measures are well defined and consider their evaluation in both reliable and probabilistic unreliable environments. On those subfamilies in which the QoS measures are well defined, we consider a set of natural related problems and analyse its computational complexity. In general our results show a clear picture of the difficulty of computing the proposed QoS measures with respect to the expressiveness of the subfamilies of Orc. Only in few cases the problems are solvable in polynomial time pointing out the computational difficulty of evaluating QoS measures even in simplified models.",
