    "title": "Improved PTAS for the constrained k-means problem",
    "abstract": "The k-means problem has been paid lots of attention in many fields, and each cluster of the k-means problem always satisfies locality property. In this paper, we study the constrained k-means problem, where the clusters do not satisfy locality property and can be an arbitrary partition of the set of points. Ding and Xu presented a unified framework with running time $$O(2^{poly (k/\\epsilon )} (\\log n)^{k+1} nd)$$ by applying uniform sampling and simplex lemma techniques such that a collection of size $$O(2^{poly (k/\\epsilon )} (\\log n)^{k+1})$$ of candidate sets containing approximate centers is obtained. Then, the collection is enumerated to get the one that can induce a $$(1+\\epsilon )$$ -approximation solution for the constrained k-means problem. By applying $$D^2$$ -sampling technique, Bhattacharya, Jaiswal, and Kumar presented an algorithm with running time $$O(2^{{\\tilde{O}}(k/\\epsilon )}nd)$$ , which is bounded by $$O(2^k( \\frac{2123ek}{\\epsilon ^3})^{64k/\\epsilon }knd)$$ . The algorithm outputs a collection of size $$O(2^k( \\frac{2123ek}{\\epsilon ^3})^{64k/\\epsilon })$$ of candidate sets containing approximate centers. In this paper, we present an algorithm with running time $$O((\\frac{1891ek}{\\epsilon ^2})^{8k/\\epsilon }nd)$$ such that a collection of size $$O((\\frac{1891ek}{\\epsilon ^2})^{8k/\\epsilon }n)$$ of candidate sets containing approximate centers can be obtained.",
