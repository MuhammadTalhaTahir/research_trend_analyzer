    "title": "A note on lot scheduling on a single machine to minimize maximum weighted tardiness",
    "abstract": "We study a single machine lot scheduling problem. Customersâ€™ orders may be processed simultaneously in the same lot. The order sizes are assumed to be order-dependent, and the lots have identical size and identical processing time. Orders may be split, i.e., their processing may be performed on two consecutive lots. We assume order-dependent due-dates and weights, and the goal is to minimize the maximum weighted tardiness among all orders. A polynomial time solution algorithm is introduced.",
