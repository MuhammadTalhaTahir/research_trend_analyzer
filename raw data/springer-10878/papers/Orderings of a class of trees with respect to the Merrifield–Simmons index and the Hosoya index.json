    "title": "Orderings of a class of trees with respect to the Merrifield–Simmons index and the Hosoya index",
    "abstract": "The Merrifield–Simmons index and the Hosoya index are two prominent molecular graph descriptors in mathematical chemistry. The Merrifield–Simmons index of a graph is defined as the total number of the independent sets of the graph and the Hosoya index of a graph is defined as the total number of the matchings of the graph. In this paper, the Merrifield–Simmons index and the Hosoya index of a class of trees $$ \\Gamma $$ are investigated, and their orderings and extremal trees with respect to these two topological indices are obtained, respectively.",
