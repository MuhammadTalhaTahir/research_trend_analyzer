    "title": "The w-centroids and least w-central subtrees in weighted trees",
    "abstract": "Let T be a weighted tree with a positive number w(v) associated with each vertex v. A subtree S is a w-central subtree of the weighted tree T if it has the minimum eccentricity $$e_L(S)$$ in median graph $$G_{LW}$$ . A w-central subtree with the minimum vertex weight is called a least w-central subtree of the weighted tree T. In this paper we show that each least w-central subtree of a weighted tree either contains a vertex of the w-centroid or is adjacent to a vertex of the w-centroid. Also, we show that any two least w-central subtrees of a weighted tree either have a nonempty intersection or are adjacent.",
