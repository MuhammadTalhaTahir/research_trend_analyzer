    "title": "Equivalence of two conjectures on equitable coloring of graphs",
    "abstract": "A graph G is said to be equitably k-colorable if there exists a proper k-coloring of G such that the sizes of any two color classes differ by at most one. Let Δ(G) denote the maximum degree of a vertex in G. Two Brooks-type conjectures on equitable Δ(G)-colorability have been proposed in Chen and Yen (Discrete Math., 2011) and Kierstead and Kostochka (Combinatorica 30:201–216, 2010) independently. We prove the equivalence of these conjectures.",
