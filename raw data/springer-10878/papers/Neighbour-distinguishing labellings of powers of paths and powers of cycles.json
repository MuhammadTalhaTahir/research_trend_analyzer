    "abstract": "A labelling of a graph G is a mapping $$\\pi :S \\rightarrow {\\mathcal {L}}$$, where $${\\mathcal {L}}\\subset {\\mathbb {R}}$$ and $$S \\subseteq V(G)\\cup E(G)$$. If $$S=E(G)$$, $$\\pi $$ is an $${\\mathcal {L}}$$-edge-labelling and, if $$S=V(G)\\cup E(G)$$, $$\\pi $$ is an $${\\mathcal {L}}$$-total-labelling. For each $$v\\in V(G)$$, the colour of v under $$\\pi $$ is defined as $$C_{\\pi }(v) = \\sum _{uv \\in E(G)}{\\pi (uv)}$$ if $$\\pi $$ is an $${\\mathcal {L}}$$-edge-labelling; and $$C_{\\pi }(v) = \\pi (v)+\\sum _{uv \\in E(G)}{\\pi (uv)}$$ if $$\\pi $$ is an $${\\mathcal {L}}$$-total-labelling. Labelling $$\\pi $$ is a neighbour-distinguishing $${\\mathcal {L}}$$-edge-labelling (neighbour-distinguishing $${\\mathcal {L}}$$-total-labelling) if $$\\pi $$ is an $${\\mathcal {L}}$$-edge-labelling ($${\\mathcal {L}}$$-total-labelling) and $$C_{\\pi }(u)\\ne C_{\\pi }(v)$$, for every edge $$uv \\in E(G)$$. In 2004, Karónski, Łuczac and Thomasson posed the 1,2,3-Conjecture, which states that every simple graph with no isolated edge has a neighbour-distinguishing $$\\{1,2,3\\}$$-edge-labelling. In 2010, Przybyło and Woźniak posed the 1,2-Conjecture, which states that every simple graph has a neighbour-distinguishing $$\\{1,2\\}$$-total-labelling. In this work, we contribute to the study of these conjectures by verifying the 1,2,3-Conjecture and 1,2-Conjecture for powers of paths and powers of cycles. We also obtain generalizations of these results: we prove that all powers of paths have neighbour-distinguishing $$\\{t,2t\\}$$-total-labellings and neighbour-distinguishing $$\\{t,2t,3t\\}$$-edge-labellings, for $$t\\in {\\mathbb {R}}\\backslash \\{0\\}$$; and we prove that all powers of cycles have neighbour-distinguishing $$\\{a,b\\}$$-total-labellings, and neighbour-distinguishing $$\\{t,2t,3t\\}$$-edge-labellings, for $$a,b,t\\in {\\mathbb {R}}$$, $$a\\ne b$$ and $$t\\ne 0$$",
