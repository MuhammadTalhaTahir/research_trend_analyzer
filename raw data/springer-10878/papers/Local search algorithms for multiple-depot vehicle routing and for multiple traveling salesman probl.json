    "title": "Local search algorithms for multiple-depot vehicle routing and for multiple traveling salesman problems with proved performance guarantees",
    "abstract": "We consider two related problems: the multiple-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) and the Multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP). In both of them, given is the complete graph on n vertices $$G = (V,E)$$ with nonnegative edge lengths that form a metric on V. Also given is a positive integer k. In typical applications, V represents locations of customers and k represents the number of available vehicles. In MDVPR, we are also given a set of k depots $$\\{O_1,\\ldots ,O_k\\} \\subseteq V$$ , and the goal is to find a minimum-length cycle cover of G of size k, that is, a collection of k (possibly empty) cycles such that each $$v \\in V$$ is in exactly one cycle, and each cycle in the cover contains exactly one depot. In mTSP, no depots are given, so the goal is to find (any) minimum-length cycle cover of G of size k. We present local search algorithms for both problems, and we prove that their approximation ratio is 2.",
