    "title": "Approximation algorithms for two clustered arc routing problems",
    "abstract": "Given a strongly connected mixed graph $$G=(V,E,A)$$ , where V represents the vertex set, E is the undirected edge set, and A is the directed arc set, $$R \\subseteq E$$ is a subset of required edges and is divided into p clusters $$R_1,R_2,\\dots ,R_p$$ , and A is a set of required arcs and is partitioned into q clusters $$A_1,A_2,\\ldots ,A_q$$ . Each edge in E and each arc in A are associated with a nonnegative weight and the weight function satisfies the triangle inequality. In this paper we consider two clustered arc routing problems. The first is the Clustered Rural Postman Problem, in which A is empty and the objective is to find a minimum-weight closed walk such that all the edges in R are serviced and the edges in $$R_i$$ &nbsp;( $$1\\le i \\le p$$ ) are serviced consecutively. The other is the Clustered Stacker Crane Problem, in which R is empty and the goal is to find a minimum-weight closed walk that traverses all the arcs in A and services the arcs in $$A_j$$ &nbsp;( $$1\\le j \\le q$$ ) consecutively. For both problems, we propose constant-factor approximation algorithms with ratios 13/6 and 19/6, respectively.",
