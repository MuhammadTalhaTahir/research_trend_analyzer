    "title": "Edge-disjoint spanning trees and the number of maximum state circles of a graph",
    "abstract": "Motivated by the connection with the genus of unoriented alternating links, Jin et al. (Acta Math Appl Sin Engl Ser, 2015) introduced the number of maximum state circles of a plane graph G, denoted by $$s_{\\max }(G)$$ , and proved that $$s_{\\max }(G)=\\max \\{e(H)+2c(H)-v(H)|$$ H is a spanning subgraph of $$G\\}$$ , where e(H),&nbsp;c(H) and v(H) denote the size, the number of connected components and the order of H, respectively. In this paper, we show that for any (not necessarily planar) graph G, $$s_{\\max }(G)$$ can be achieved by the spanning subgraph H of G whose each connected component is a maximal subgraph of G with two edge-disjoint spanning trees. Such a spanning subgraph is proved to be unique and we present a polynomial-time algorithm to find such a spanning subgraph for any graph G.",
