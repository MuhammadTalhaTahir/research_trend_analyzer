    "title": "Approximation algorithms for two variants of correlation clustering problem",
    "abstract": "Correlation clustering problem is a clustering problem which has many applications such as protein interaction networks, cross-lingual link detection, communication networks, and social computing. In this paper, we introduce two variants of correlation clustering problem: correlation clustering problem on uncertain graphs and correlation clustering problem with non-uniform hard constrained cluster sizes. Both problems overcome part of the limitations of the existing variants of correlation clustering problem and have practical applications in the real world. We provide a constant approximation algorithm and two approximation algorithms for the former and the latter problem, respectively.",
