    "title": "The popular matching and condensation problems under matroid constraints",
    "abstract": "The popular matching problem introduced by Abraham, Irving, Kavitha, and Mehlhorn is a matching problem in which there exist applicants and posts, and applicants have preference lists over posts. A matching M is said to be popular, if there exists no other matching N such that the number of applicants that prefer N to M is larger than the number of applicants that prefer M to N. The goal of this problem is to decide whether there exists a popular matching, and find a popular matching if one exists. In this paper, we first consider a matroid generalization of the popular matching problem with strict preference lists, and give a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. In the second half of this paper, we consider the problem of transforming a given instance of a matroid generalization of the popular matching problem with strict preference lists by deleting a minimum number of applicants so that it has a popular matching. This problem is a matroid generalization of the popular condensation problem with strict preference lists introduced by Wu, Lin, Wang, and Chao. By using the results in the first half, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem.",
