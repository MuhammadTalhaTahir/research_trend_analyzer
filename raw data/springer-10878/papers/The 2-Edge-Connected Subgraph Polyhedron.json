    "title": "The 2-Edge-Connected Subgraph Polyhedron",
    "abstract": "We study the polyhedron P(G) defined by the convex hull of 2-edge-connected subgraphs of G where multiple copies of edges may be chosen. We show that each vertex of P(G) is also a vertex of the LP relaxation. Given the close relationship with the Graphical Traveling Salesman problem (GTSP), we examine how polyhedral results for GTSP can be modified and applied to P(G). We characterize graphs for which P(G) is integral and study how this relates to a similar result for GTSP. In addition, we show how one can modify some classes of valid inequalities for GTSP and produce new valid inequalities and facets for P(G).",
