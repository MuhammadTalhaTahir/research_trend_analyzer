    "title": "An FPTAS for uniform machine scheduling to minimize makespan with linear deterioration",
    "abstract": "This paper consider m uniform (parallel) machine scheduling with linear deterioration to minimize the makespan. In an uniform machine environment, all machines have different processing speeds. Linear deterioration means that jobâ€™s actual processing time is a linear increasing function on its execution starting time. We propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) to show the problem is NP-hard in the ordinary sense.",
