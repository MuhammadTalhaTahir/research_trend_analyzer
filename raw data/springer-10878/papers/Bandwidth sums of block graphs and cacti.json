    "title": "Bandwidth sums of block graphs and cacti",
    "abstract": "A labeling of a graph G is an injective function f:V(G)→ℤ. The bandwidth sum of a graph G with respect to a labeling f is $B_{s}^{f}(G) = \\sum_{uv \\in E(G)} |f(u)-f(v)|$ and the bandwidth sum of G is $B_{s}(G) = \\min\\{B_{s}^{f}(G)\\colon f\\mbox{ is a labeling of }G\\}$ . In this paper, we determine bandwidth sums for some block graphs and cacti.",
