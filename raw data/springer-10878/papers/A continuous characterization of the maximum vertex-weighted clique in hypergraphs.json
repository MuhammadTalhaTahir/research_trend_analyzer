    "title": "A continuous characterization of the maximum vertex-weighted clique in hypergraphs",
    "abstract": "For a simple graph G on n vertices with adjacency matrix A, Motzkin and Strauss established a remarkable connection between the clique number and the global maximum value of the quadratic programm: $$\\textit{max}\\{ \\mathbf {x}^T A \\mathbf {x}\\}$$ on the standard simplex: $$\\{\\sum _{i=1}^{n} x_i =1, x_i \\ge 0 \\}$$ . In Gibbons et al. (Math Oper Res 122:754–768, 1997), an extension of the Motzkin–Straus formulation was provided for the vertex-weighted clique number of a graph. In this paper, we provide a continuous characterization of the maximum vertex-weighted clique problem for vertex-weighted uniform hypergraphs.",
