    "title": "On irreducible no-hole L(2,Â 1)-coloring of subdivision of graphs",
    "abstract": "An L(2,&nbsp;1)-coloring (or labeling) of a graph G is a mapping $$f:V(G) \\rightarrow \\mathbb {Z}^{+}\\bigcup \\{0\\}$$ such that $$|f(u)-f(v)|\\ge 2$$ for all edges uv of G, and $$|f(u)-f(v)|\\ge 1$$ if u and v are at distance two in G. The span of an L(2,&nbsp;1)-coloring f, denoted by span&nbsp;f, is the largest integer assigned by f to some vertex of the graph. The span of a graph G, denoted by $$\\lambda (G)$$ , is min {span&nbsp; $$f: f\\text {is an }L(2,1)\\text {-coloring of } G\\}$$ . If f is an L(2,&nbsp;1)-coloring of a graph G with span k then an integer l is a hole in f, if $$l\\in (0,k)$$ and there is no vertex v in G such that $$f(v)=l$$ . A no-hole coloring is defined to be an L(2,&nbsp;1)-coloring with span k which uses all the colors from $$\\{0,1,\\ldots ,k\\}$$ , for some integer k not necessarily the span of the graph. An L(2,&nbsp;1)-coloring is said to be irreducible if colors of no vertices in the graph can be decreased and yield another L(2,&nbsp;1)-coloring of the same graph. An irreducible no-hole coloring of a graph G, also called inh-coloring of G, is an L(2,&nbsp;1)-coloring of G which is both irreducible and no-hole. The lower inh-span or simply inh-span of a graph G, denoted by $$\\lambda _{inh}(G)$$ , is defined as $$\\lambda _{inh}(G)=\\min ~\\{$$ span&nbsp;f&nbsp;:&nbsp;f is an inh-coloring of G}. Given a graph G and a function h from E(G) to $$\\mathbb {N}$$ , the h-subdivision of G, denoted by $$G_{(h)}$$ , is the graph obtained from G by replacing each edge uv in G with a path of length h(uv). In this paper we show that $$G_{(h)}$$ is inh-colorable for $$h(e)\\ge 2$$ , $$e\\in E(G)$$ , except the case $$\\Delta =3$$ and $$h(e)=2$$ for at least one edge but not for all. Moreover we find the exact value of $$\\lambda _{inh}(G_{(h)})$$ in several cases and give upper bounds of the same in the remaining.",
