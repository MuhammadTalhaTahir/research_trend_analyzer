    "title": "L(p,q)-labeling of sparse graphs",
    "abstract": "Let p and q be positive integers. An L(p,q)-labeling of a graph G with a span s is a labeling of its vertices by integers between 0 and s such that adjacent vertices of G are labeled using colors at least p apart, and vertices having a common neighbor are labeled using colors at least q apart. We denote by λ p,q (G) the least integer k such that G has an L(p,q)-labeling with span k. The maximum average degree of a graph G, denoted by $\\operatorname {Mad}(G)$ , is the maximum among the average degrees of its subgraphs (i.e. $\\operatorname {Mad}(G) = \\max\\{\\frac{2|E(H)|}{|V(H)|} ; H \\subseteq G \\}$ ). We consider graphs G with $\\operatorname {Mad}(G) &lt; \\frac{10}{3}$ , 3 and $\\frac{14}{5}$ . These sets of graphs contain planar graphs with girth 5, 6 and 7 respectively. We prove in this paper that every graph G with maximum average degree m and maximum degree Δ has: We give also some refined bounds for specific values of p, q, or Δ. By the way we improve results of Lih and Wang (SIAM J. Discrete Math. 17(2):264–275, 2003).",
