    "title": "Characterizing 3-uniform linear extremal hypergraphs on feedback vertex number",
    "abstract": "Let $$H=(V,E)$$ be a hypergraph with vertex set V and edge set E. $$S\\subseteq V$$ is a feedback vertex set (FVS) of H if $$H\\setminus S$$ has no cycle and $$\\tau _c(H)$$ denote the minimum cardinality of a FVS of H. Chen et al. [IWOCA,2016] has proven if H is a linear 3-uniform hypergraph with m edges, then $$\\tau _c(H)\\le m/3$$ . In this paper, we furthermore characterize all the extremal hypergraphs with $$\\tau _c(H)= m/3$$ holds. This result has a direct application to Tuzaâ€™s conjecture.",
