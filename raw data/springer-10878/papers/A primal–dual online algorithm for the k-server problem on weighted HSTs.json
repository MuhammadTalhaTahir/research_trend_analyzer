    "abstract": "In this paper, we show that there is a $$\\frac{5}{2}\\ell \\cdot \\ln (1+k)$$ -competitive randomized algorithm for the k-sever problem on weighted Hierarchically Separated Trees (HSTs) with depth $$\\ell $$ when $$n=k+1$$ where n is the number of points in the metric space, which improved previous best competitive ratio $$12 \\ell \\ln (1+4\\ell (1+k))$$ by Bansal et al. (FOCS, pp 267–276, 2011).",
