    "title": "On the lower bounds of random Max 3 and 4-SAT",
    "abstract": "A k-CNF formula is said to be p-satisfiable if there exists a truth assignment satisfying a fraction of $$1-2^{-k}+p2^{-k}$$ of its clauses. We obtain better lower bounds for random 3 and 4-SAT to be p-satisfiable. The technique we use is a delicate weighting scheme of the second moment method, where for every clause we give appropriate weight to truth assignments according to their number of satisfied literal occurrences.",
