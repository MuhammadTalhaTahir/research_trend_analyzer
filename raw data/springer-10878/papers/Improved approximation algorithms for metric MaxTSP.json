    "title": "Improved approximation algorithms for metric MaxTSP",
    "abstract": "We present two polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the metric case of the maximum traveling salesman problem. One of them is for directed graphs and its approximation ratio is $$\\frac{27}{35}$$ . The other is for undirected graphs and its approximation ratio is $$\\frac{7}{8}-o(1)$$ . Both algorithms improve on the previous bests.",
