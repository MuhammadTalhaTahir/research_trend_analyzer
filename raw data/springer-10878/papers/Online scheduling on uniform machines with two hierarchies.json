    "abstract": "In this paper we study online scheduling problem on m parallel uniform machines with two hierarchies. The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan). Machines are provided with different capability. The machines with speed s can schedule all jobs, while the other machines with speed 1 can only process partial jobs. Online algorithms for any 0",
