    "title": "Multiplicatively weighted Harary index of graphs",
    "abstract": "Let $$G$$ be a connected graph with vertex set $$V(G)$$ . The multiplicatively weighted Harary index of a graph $$G$$ is defined as $$H_M(G)=\\sum _{u\\ne v}\\frac{d(u)d(v)}{d(u,v)}$$ , where $$d(u)$$ is the degree of vertex $$u$$ , and $$d(u,v)$$ denotes the distance between $$u$$ and $$v$$ . In this paper, we first prove that the multiplicatively weighted Harary index of a graph is monotonic on some transformations, and then determine the extremal values of the multiplicatively weighted Harary indices for some familiar classes of graphs and characterize the corresponding extremal graphs.",
