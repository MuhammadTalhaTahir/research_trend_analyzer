    "title": "Random Pooling Designs Under Various Structures",
    "abstract": "Balding et al. (1995) showed that randomizing over the k-set space yields much better pooling designs than the random pooling design without the k-restriction. A natural question arises as to whether a smaller subspace, i.e., a space with more structure, will yield even better results. We take the random subset containment design recently proposed by Macula, which randomizes over a subspace of the k-set space, as our guinea pig to compare with the k-set space. Unfortunately the performance of the subset containment design is hard to analyze and only approximations are given. For a set of parameters, we are able to produce either an exact analysis or very good approximations. The comparisons under these parameters seem to favor the k-set space.",
