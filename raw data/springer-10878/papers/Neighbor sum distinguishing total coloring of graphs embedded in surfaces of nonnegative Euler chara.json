    "title": "Neighbor sum distinguishing total coloring of graphs embedded in surfaces of nonnegative Euler characteristic",
    "abstract": "A total coloring of a graph $$G$$ is a coloring of its vertices and edges such that adjacent or incident vertices and edges are not colored with the same color. A total $$[k]$$ -coloring of a graph $$G$$ is a total coloring of $$G$$ by using the color set $$[k]=\\{1,2,\\ldots ,k\\}$$ . Let $$f(v)$$ denote the sum of the colors of a vertex $$v$$ and the colors of all incident edges of $$v$$ . A total $$[k]$$ -neighbor sum distinguishing-coloring of $$G$$ is a total $$[k]$$ -coloring of $$G$$ such that for each edge $$uv\\in E(G)$$ , $$f(u)\\ne f(v)$$ . Let $$G$$ be a graph which can be embedded in a surface of nonnegative Euler characteristic. In this paper, it is proved that the total neighbor sum distinguishing chromatic number of $$G$$ is $$\\Delta (G)+2$$ if $$\\Delta (G)\\ge 14$$ , where $$\\Delta (G)$$ is the maximum degree of $$G$$ .",
