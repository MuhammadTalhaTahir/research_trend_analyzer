    "title": "Testing Higher-order Clusterability on Graphs",
    "abstract": "Analysis of higher-order organizations, represented as small connected subgraphs, is a fundamental task on complex networks. This paper studies a new problem of testing higher-order clusterability: given neighbor query access to an undirected graph, can we judge whether this graph can be partitioned into a few clusters of highly-connected cliques? This problem is an extension of the former work proposed by Czumaj et al. (STOCâ€™ 15), who recognized cluster structure on graphs using the framework of property testing. In this paper, the problem of testing whether a well-defined higher-order cluster exists is first defined. Then, an $$\\varOmega (\\sqrt{n})$$ query lower bound of this problem is given. After that, a baseline algorithm is provided by an edge-cluster tester on k-clique dual graph. Finally, an optimized $$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$$ -time algorithm is developed for testing clusterability based on triangles.",
