    "title": "Fault-tolerant diameter for three family interconnection networks",
    "abstract": "Let G=(V,E) be an k-connected graph. The (k−1)-fault-tolerant diameter of G, denoted by D k (G), is defined as D k (G)=max {d(G−F)|F⊂V(G)&nbsp;and&nbsp;|F|=k−1}, where G−F denotes the subgraph induced by V(G)−F. The fault-tolerant diameter is one important parameter for measuring the reliability and efficiency of interconnection networks. In this paper, we will give the bounds of fault-tolerant diameter of three family interconnection networks.",
