    "title": "The Incremental Group Testing Model for Gap Closing in Sequencing Long Molecules",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the incremental group testing model for the gap closing problem, which assumes that we can tell the difference between the outcome of testing a subset S, and the outcome of testing S âˆª {x}. We also give improvements over currently best results in literature for some other models.",
