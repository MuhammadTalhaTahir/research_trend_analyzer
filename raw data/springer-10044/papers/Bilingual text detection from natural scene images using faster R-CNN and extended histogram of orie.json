    "title": "Bilingual text detection from natural scene images using faster R-CNN and extended histogram of oriented gradients",
    "abstract": "In today's world, scene text detection is important for a wide range of scientific and industrial processes. Compared with text detection in documents, text detection in natural scenes is challenging since they are subjected to different orientations, scaling, brightness variations, and complex backgrounds. Further scenes can contain multiple scripts which limits the performance of detection algorithms. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art algorithm for text detection for a bilingual natural scene dataset. The framework consists of (a) Faster R-CNN employed to extract probable text regions within the scene images, (b) rearrangement of the text region as consecutive frames along the time axis and extraction of global and local shape features from the three orthogonal planes and (c) use of simple and effective classifier to predict the features extracted from regions as text or non-text region. The proposed frame when compared to other text detection techniques improves the overall text detection accuracy. The validity of the algorithm is verified on the bilingual text detection dataset MSRA-TD500, and a promising F1 score of 0.70 is reported.",
