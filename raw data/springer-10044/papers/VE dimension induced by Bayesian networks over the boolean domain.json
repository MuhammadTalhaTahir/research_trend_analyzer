    "title": "VE dimension induced by Bayesian networks over the boolean domain",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the concept classes $${\\mathcal {C}}_{{\\mathcal{N}}}$$ induced by Bayesian networks. The relationship between two-dimensional values induced by these concept classes is studied, one of which is the VC-dimension of the concept class $${\\mathcal {C}}_{\\cal {N}},$$ denoted as $$VCdim({\\mathcal {N}}), $$ and other is the smallest dimensional of Euclidean spaces into which $${\\mathcal {C}}_{{\\mathcal {N}}}$$ can be embedded, denoted as $$Edim({\\mathcal {N}}). $$ As a main result, we show that the two-dimensional values are equal for the Bayesian networks with n&nbsp;≤&nbsp;4 variables, called the VE-dimension for that Bayesian networks.",
