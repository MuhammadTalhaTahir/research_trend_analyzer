    "title": "A computer-based quantitative assessment of visuo-spatial neglect using regression and data transformation",
    "abstract": "Computer-based assessment systems analysing the drawing responses from a test subject have been widely explored within the area of neuropsychological dysfunction diagnosis and rehabilitation monitoring. This study reports on the development of a quantitative marking system for the automated assessment of visuo-spatial neglect. Using a clinically established pencil-and-paper based method as a marking benchmark, a set of features are extracted and selected from a battery of computer-captured drawing tasks. Through the application of linear regression and data transformation, the novel system is shown to be effective in correlating against a clinically recognised scale, while simultaneously improving the efficiency of the testing process.",
