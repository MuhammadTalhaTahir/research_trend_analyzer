    "title": "Algorithm of designing compound recognition system on the basis of combining classifiers with simultaneous splitting feature space into competence areas",
    "abstract": "The paper presents the novel adaptive splitting and selection algorithm (AdaSS) used for learning compound pattern recognition system. Splitting a feature space into its constituents and selection of the best area classifier from the pool of available recognizers for each region are key processes of the proposed model. Both take place simultaneously as part of a compound optimization process aimed at maximizing system performance. Evolutionary algorithms are used to find out the optimal solution. The results of experiments for algorithm evaluation purposes prove the quality of the proposed approach.",
