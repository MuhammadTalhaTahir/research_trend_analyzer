    "title": "A new invariant descriptor for action recognition based on spherical harmonics",
    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to introduce a new descriptor for the spatio-temporal volume (STV). Human motion is completely represented by STV (action volume) which is constructed over successive frames by stacking human silhouettes in consecutive frames. Action volume comprehensively contains spatial and temporal information about an action. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new affine invariant action volume descriptor based on a function of spherical harmonic coefficients. This means, it is invariant under rotation, non-uniform scaling and translation. In the 3D shape analysis literature, there have been a few attempts to use coefficients of spherical harmonics to describe a 3D shape. However, those descriptors are not affine invariant and they are only rotation invariant. In addition, the proposed approach employs a parametric form of spherical harmonics that handles genus zero surfaces regardless of whether they are stellar or not. Another contribution of this paper is the way that action volume is constructed. We applied the proposed descriptor to the KTH, Weizmann, IXMAS and Robust datasets and compared the performance of our algorithm to competing methods available in the literature. The results of our experiments show that our method has a comparable performance to the most successful and recent existing algorithms.",
