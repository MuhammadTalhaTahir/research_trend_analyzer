    "title": "Symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization with elastic-net regularized block-wise weighted representation for clustering",
    "abstract": "In unsupervised learning, symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has proven its efficacy for various clustering tasks in recent years, considering both linearly and nonlinearly separable data. On the other hand, block-wise weighted sparse representation-based classification (BW-SRC), a recently proposed sparse representation technique improved sparse coding features for supervised classification. In this work, we take advantage of both techniques to device a new unsupervised image clustering algorithm. A disadvantage of symmetric NMF is its computational burden associated to the quadratic growth of its similarity matrix. We reduce this computation by first working with sub-sampled data and then by working with the full data samples in a second stage elastic-net coefficient estimation problem with previously learned block-wise weights. This decreases both the computational time and the memory requirements when solving for symmetric NMF, but at the same time allows to cluster the full data samples in a robust way. We either outperform or achieve highly competitive results with previous matrix factorization clustering methods on seven benchmark image datasets.",
