    "title": "Efficient distance-based per-pixel texture classification with Gabor wavelet filters",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes an efficient solution to the problem of per-pixel classification of textured images with multichannel Gabor wavelet filters based on a selection scheme that automatically determines a subset of prototypes that characterize each texture class. Results with Brodatz compositions and outdoor images, and comparisons with alternative classification techniques are presented.",
