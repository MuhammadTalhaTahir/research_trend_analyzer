    "title": "Face recognition using an NNSRM classifier in LDA subspace",
    "abstract": "NNSRM is an implementation of the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle using the nearest neighbor (NN) rule, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a dimension-reducing method, which is usually used in classifications. This paper combines the two methods for face recognition. We first project the face images into a PCA subspace, then project the results into a much lower-dimensional LDA subspace, and then use an NNSRM classifier to recognize them in the LDA subspace. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined method can achieve a better performance than NN by selecting different distances and a comparable performance with SVM but costing less computational time.",
