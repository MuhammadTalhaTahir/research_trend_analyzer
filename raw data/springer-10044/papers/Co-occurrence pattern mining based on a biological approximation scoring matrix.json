    "title": "Co-occurrence pattern mining based on a biological approximation scoring matrix",
    "abstract": "Mining co-occurrence frequency patterns from multiple sequences is a hot topic in bioinformatics. Many seemingly disorganized constituents repetitively appear under different biological matrices, such as PAM250 and BLOSUM62, which are considered hidden frequent patterns (FPs). A hidden FP with both gap and flexible approximation operations (replacement, deletion or insertion) deepens the difficulty in discovering its true occurrences. To effectively discover co-occurrence FPs (Co-FPs) under these conditions, we design a mining algorithm (co-fp-miner) using the following steps: (1) a biological approximation scoring matrix is designed to discover various deformations of a single FP pattern; (2) a data-driven intersection tactic is used to generate candidate Co-FPs; (3) a deterministic Apriori-like rule is proposed to prune unnecessary Co-FPs; and (4) finally, we employ a backtracking matching scheme to validate true Co-FPs. The co-fp-miner algorithm is an unified framework for both exact and approximate mining on multiple sequences. Experiments on DNA and protein sequences demonstrate that co-fp-miner is more efficient on solutions, time and memory consumption than that of other peers.",
