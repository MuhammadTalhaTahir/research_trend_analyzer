    "title": "Segmentation of microscope images of living cells",
    "abstract": "This paper describes a segmentation method combining a texture based technique with a contour based method. The technique is designed to enable the study of cell behaviour over time by segmenting brightfield microscope image sequences. The technique was tested on artificial images, based on images of living cells and on real sequences acquired from microscope observations of neutrophils and lymphocytes as well as on a sequence of MRI images. The results of the segmentation are compared with the results of the watershed and snake segmentation methods. The results show that the method is both effective and practical.",
