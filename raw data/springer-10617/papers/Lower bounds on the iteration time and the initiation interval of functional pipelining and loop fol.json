    "title": "Lower bounds on the iteration time and the initiation interval of functional pipelining and loop folding",
    "abstract": "The performance of pipelined datapath implementations is measured basically by three parameters: the clock cycle length, the initiation interval between successive iterations (inverse of the throughput) and the iteration time (turn-around time). In this paper we present a new method for computing performance bounds of pipelined implementations: The method has a low complexity and it handles behavioral specifications containing loop statements with interiteration data dependency and timing constraints.",
