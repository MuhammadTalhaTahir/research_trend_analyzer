    "title": "Communication Performance Models for Architecture-Precise Prototyping of Real-Time Embedded Systems",
    "abstract": "This paper presents performance models of different communication links for precise performance estimation of communication structures in complex hardware/software systems. Communication performance models are the basis for efficient communication architecture synthesis with real-time constraints. Based on a pre-partitioned mixed hardware/software description and given communication and timing constraints, a thorough analysis of different communication structures is performed automatically to guide the synthesis of optimized communication architectures. The hardware/software system including the derived communication structure will be emulated as an architecture-precise prototype on a reconfigurable real-time execution platform.",
