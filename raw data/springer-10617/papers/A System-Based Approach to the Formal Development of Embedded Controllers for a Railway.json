    "title": "A System-Based Approach to the Formal Development of Embedded Controllers for a Railway",
    "abstract": "We describe a formal approach to the development of embedded controllers for a railway. The approach starts with a system-level specification modeling the system under control and the desired control behavior. Correctness-preserving refinement is then used to add more and more implementation detail to the models and to decompose the models into sub-systems to arrive at models of individual controllers. The B Method is used as the formal notation and methodology.",
