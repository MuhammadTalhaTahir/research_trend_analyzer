    "title": "Design and evaluation of an energy efficient DiamondMesh topology for on-chip interconnection networks",
    "abstract": "The present research work proposes an energy efficient diagonal mesh based topology called DiamondMesh. By introducing diagonal links into the baseline mesh topology, the proposed DiamondMesh improves network performance while retaining the regular, simple and scalable properties of the Mesh topology. Topological properties of DiamondMesh have been explored and compared with that of other competitive diagonal mesh topologies. With the help of Booksim2.0 simulator, the proposed topology has been evaluated under a variety of traffic patterns and the results have been compared to those obtained with Mesh and the existing diagonal mesh topologies. The proposed topology and other considered topologies have been synthesised using xilinx vivado design compiler and the results have been analysed. The evaluation results show that there has been a significant reduction of latency compared to Mesh and other diagonal mesh topologies except DMesh and a considerable reduction of area and power compared to the DMesh topology. Thus, DiamondMesh establishes to be a highly efficient diagonal mesh-based topology for a variety of applications.",
