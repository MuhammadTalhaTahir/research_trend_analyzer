    "title": "Population topologies for particle swarm optimization and differential evolution",
    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, many population-based swarm and  evolutionary algorithms  were introduced in the literature. It is well known that population topology or sociometry plays an important role in improving the performance of population-based  optimization algorithms  by enhancing population diversity when solving multiobjective and multimodal problems. Many population structures and population topologies were developed for  particle swarm optimization  and differential  evolutionary algorithms . Therefore, a comprehensive review of population topologies developed for PSO and DE is carried out in this paper. We anticipate that this survey will inspire researchers to integrate the population topologies into other nature inspired algorithms and to develop novel population topologies for improving the performances of population-based optimization algorithms for solving single  objective optimization ,  multiobjective optimization  and other classes of  optimization problems .",
