    "title": "PCA-assisted reproduction for continuous multi-objective optimization with complicated Pareto optimal set",
    "abstract": "In terms of generating  offspring  solutions, simulated binary crossover (SBX) and differential evolution (DE) are two of the most representative reproduction operators in evolutionary multi-objective algorithms (EMOAs). However, they are found as less effective on multi-objective problems (MOPs) with complicated  Pareto optimal set  (PS). Under mild conditions, the PS of an MOP is an  ( m âˆ’ 1 ) -dimensional piecewise continuous manifolds where  m  is the number of objectives. Inspired from this regularity property, this study proposes a simple yet effective reproduction operator, namely, PCA-assisted reproduction (PCA-ar). Specifically, the PCA-ar first applies principal component analysis (PCA) method to construct a new decision space with reduced number of dimensions based on the information extracted from several well converged solutions. The PS is then estimated by a  hyperplane  in the new decision space. To this end, new offspring are sampled from the estimated PS, and then re-converted to the original decision space for fitness calculation. In order to systematically examine the effectiveness of the PCA-ar operator, we integrate it into NSGA-II and MOEA/D, and compare the derived algorithms, nNSGA-II and nMOEA/D, with their original versions (NSGA-II with SBX operator and MOEA/D with DE operator) as well as the regularity model based multi-objective estimated distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) on the modified DTLZ benchmarks with up to 8 objectives. Experimental results show that nNSGA-II and nMOEA/D outperform the competitor EMOAs for most of problems, which indicate that the PCA-ar is effective. Lastly, the PCA-ar is also demonstrated to have good scalability to the number of decision variables.",
