    "title": "Quantum inspired genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization using chaotic map model based interference for gray level image thresholding",
    "abstract": "In this paper, two meta-heuristics techniques have been employed to introduce two new quantum inspired meta-heuristic methods, namely quantum inspired  genetic algorithm  and quantum inspired  particle swarm optimization  for bi-level thresholding. The proposed methods use Otsu's method, Ramesh's method, Li's method, Shanbag's method and also  correlation coefficient  as evaluation functions to determine optimal threshold values of gray-level images. They exploit the trivial concepts of  quantum computing  such as  qubits  and superposition of states. These properties help to exhibit the feature of  parallelism  that in turn utilizes the time discreteness of quantum  mechanical systems . The proposed methods have been compared with their classical counterparts and later with the quantum  evolutionary algorithm  (QEA) proposed by Han et al. to evaluate the performance among all participating algorithms for three test images. The optimal threshold value with the corresponding fitness value, standard deviation of fitness and finally the computational time of each method for each test image have been reported. The results prove that the proposed methods are time efficient while compared to their conventional counterparts. Another  comparative study  of the proposed methods with the quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) proposed by Han et al. also reveals the weaknesses of the latter.",
