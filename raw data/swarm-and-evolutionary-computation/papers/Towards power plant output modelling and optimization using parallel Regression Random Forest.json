    "title": "Towards power plant output modelling and optimization using parallel Regression Random Forest",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the possibilities of using the  Random Forest  algorithm in its regression version to predict the  power output  of a  power plant  based on hourly measured data. This is a task commonly leading to a  optimization problem  that is, in general, best solved using a bio-inspired technique. We extend the results already published on this topic and show that Regression Random Forest can be a better alternative to solve the problem. A comparison of the method with previously published results is included. In order to implement the algorithm in a way that is as efficient as possible, a massively parallel implementation using a  Graphics Processing Unit  was used and is also described.",
