    "title": "Biogeography based optimization technique for best compromise solution of economic emission dispatch",
    "abstract": "This paper attempts to develop an elegant  biogeography  based optimization algorithm for obtaining the best compromise solution of EED problem. The basic philosophy orients to create a modified objective function that provides equal significance to both fuel cost and emission cost components. Besides it requires only three solution runs unlike other strategies involving more solution runs. The performance is evaluated through three test systems and the simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the scheme for practical applications.",
