    "title": "Evolutionary and GPU computing for topology optimization of structures",
    "abstract": "Although  structural topology optimization , as a discrete optimization problem, has been successfully solved several times in the literature using evolutionary algorithms (EAs), the two key difficulties lie in generating geometrically feasible structures and handling a high computation time. These two challenges are addressed in this paper by adopting triangular representation for two-dimensional continuum structures, related crossover and  mutation operators , and by performing computations in parallel on the  graphics processing unit  (GPU). Two  case studies  are solved on the GPU that show 5Ã— of speedup over CPU implementation. The  parametric study  on the  population size  of EA shows that the approximate Pareto-optimal solutions can be evolved using a small population with the proposed EA operators.",
