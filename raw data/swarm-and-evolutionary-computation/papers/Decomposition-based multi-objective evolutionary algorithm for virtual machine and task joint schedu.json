    "title": "Decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for virtual machine and task joint scheduling of cloud computing in data space",
    "abstract": "Efficient Virtual Machine (VM) placement and  task scheduling  is considered a major challenge in  cloud computing , given that the scheduling results directly affect user satisfaction and vendor benefits. This paper investigates the VM and task  joint  scheduling (VTJS) problem, and establishes a multi-objective mathematical model with the aim to minimize makespan, cost, and total tardiness. To solve this problem, a problem-specific three-layer encoding approach is designed, and a decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with pre-selection and dynamic  resource allocation  (MOEA/D-PD) is proposed, in which a customized two-stage guided  local search method  is also embedded. In MOEA/D-PD, a  classifier model  is built to filter the  offspring  solutions in decision space so that only promising solutions are evaluated, and  computational resources  are dynamically allocated to the  subproblems  on the bases of their contributions. The proposed algorithm is validated on a series of instances of different scales and compared with six state-of-the-art MOEAs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the most known approaches from the literature.",
