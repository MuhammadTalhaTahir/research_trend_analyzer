    "title": "Fault tolerant scheduling of hard real-time tasks on multiprocessor system using a hybrid genetic algorithm",
    "abstract": "Conventional methods for fault-tolerant scheduling of real-time tasks based on traditional heuristic approach offer poor performance and inefficient system utilization. The primary-backup (PB) approach is often used as a fault-tolerant scheduling technique to guarantee RT tasks to meet their deadline despite the presence of fault. We propose a novel  scheduling algorithm  using optimization approach based on  genetic algorithm  (GA) hybridized with knowledge from the real-time  task scheduling  domain for providing fault-tolerance (FT) in  multiprocessor  environment. Exhaustive simulation reveals that the new GA based primary-backup fault-tolerant scheduling (PBFTS) approach outperforms other fault-tolerant scheduling schemes in terms of system utilization and efficiency.",
