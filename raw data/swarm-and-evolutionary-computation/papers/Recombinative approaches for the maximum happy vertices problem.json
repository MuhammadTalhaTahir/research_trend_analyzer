    "title": "Recombinative approaches for the maximum happy vertices problem",
    "abstract": "The maximum happy vertices problem involves taking a simple graph in which several vertices are precoloured. The aim is to colour the remaining vertices to maximise the number  happy  vertices, where a vertex is considered happy if and only if all of its neighbours are assigned the same colour as the vertex itself. Previous studies for this problem have investigated  integer programming ,  tabu search  and the construct, solve, merge & adapt (CMSA)  matheuristic . In this study, we develop three different evolutionary approaches based on tabu search and also develop a CMSA-tabu search (CMSA-TS) hybrid. We conduct experiments on a wide range of  d -regular and scale-free graphs and find that, overall, CMSA-TS is the most effective approach, nearly always finding the best-observed solutions. However, in special cases where problems have large numbers of vertices and low vertex degrees, the  evolutionary algorithms  have a distinct advantage.",
