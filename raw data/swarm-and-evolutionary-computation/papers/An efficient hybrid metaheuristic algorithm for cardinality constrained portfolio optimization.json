    "title": "An efficient hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for cardinality constrained portfolio optimization",
    "abstract": "Portfolio optimization with  cardinality  constraints turns out to be a mixed-integer  quadratic programming  problem which is proven to be NP-Complete that limits the efficiency of exact solution approaches, often because of the long-running times. Therefore, particular attention has been given to approximate approaches such as  metaheuristics  which do not guarantee  optimality , yet may expeditiously provide near-optimal solutions. The purpose of this study is to present an efficient hybrid  metaheuristic algorithm  that combines critical components from continuous  ant colony optimization ,  artificial bee colony optimization  and  genetic algorithms  for solving  cardinality  constrained portfolio  optimization problem . Computational results on seven publicly available benchmark problems confirm the effectiveness of the hybrid integration mechanism. Moreover, comparisons against other methodsâ€™ results in the literature reveal that the proposed solution approach is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.",
