    "title": "Improved meta-heuristics with Q-learning for solving distributed assembly permutation flowshop scheduling problems",
    "abstract": "This study addresses a distributed assembly permutation  flowshop scheduling  problem, which is of great significance in practical  manufacturing systems . We aim to sequence products and jobs, and assign jobs to the appropriate factory to minimize the total flowtime of products. First, a mathematical model is developed to describe the concerned problems. Then, four meta-heuristics, e.g., artificial bee colony,  particle swarm optimization ,  genetic algorithm , and Jaya algorithm, and their variants are proposed. Three initialization strategies are developed to generate high-quality initial solutions. Four local search operators are designed to improve the performance of the algorithms. Q-learning is embedded to select the premium local search strategy during iterations. Based on 81 large-scale benchmark instances, comprehensive numerical experiments are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed Jaya with Q-learning-based local search has strong competitiveness, and it updates optimal solutions for 51 out of 81 benchmark instances.",
