    "title": "Deep and wide search assisted evolutionary algorithm with reference vector guidance for many-objective optimization",
    "abstract": "Many-objective optimization problems appear in a large many practical cases, but maintaining the convergence and diversity of solutions becomes a big challenge. In response to this, a deep and wide search assisted  evolutionary algorithm  with reference vector guidance (RVEA-DWC) is proposed. In the algorithm, a novel environmental selection criterion based on substituting  I É› +  indicator for distance is introduced to enhance the convergence, and once the selected individuals exceed the  population size  after multiple traversals, those with poor convergence or diversity are randomly eliminated. In addition, to tackle the irregular  Pareto front  shapes, the invalid reference vectors are deleted regularly, and a certain number of reference vectors with local diversity and global diversity are added, so as to conduct a overall search that combines deep search and wide search to balance exploitation and exploration. An experimental study of 5, 10, 15, 20 objectives is conducted on 60 test instances. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the other twelve many-objective evolutionary algorithms.",
