    "title": "Industrial activated sludge model identification using hyperparameter-tuned metaheuristics",
    "abstract": "This study focuses on the parameter estimation of an industrial activated sludge model using hyperparameter-tuned metaheuristic techniques. The data used in this study were collected on-site from a textile industry wastewater treatment plant. A Modified Activated Sludge Model (M-ASM) was the 'first-principle modelâ€™ selected and implemented with suitable assumptions. Advanced metaheuristic techniques, as Adaptive Tunicate Swarm Optimization (ATSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Rao-3 Optimization (Rao-3) and Driving Training Based Optimization (DTBO) were implemented. The hyperparameter tuning was performed with Bayesian Optimization (BO). Optimized metaheuristic algorithms were implemented for model-parameter identification. The Bayesian optimized Rao-3(BO-Rao-3) algorithm provided the best validation results, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 7.0141 and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) value of 0.2629. It also had the least execution time. BO-Rao-3 is 0.93% to 4.7% better than the other implemented hyperparameter-tuned metaheuristic techniques.",
