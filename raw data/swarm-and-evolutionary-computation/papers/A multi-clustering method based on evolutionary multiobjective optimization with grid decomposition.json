    "title": "A multi-clustering method based on evolutionary multiobjective optimization with grid decomposition",
    "abstract": "At present, it is a challenging task to determine the number of clusters ( k ), which has a great impact on the quality of major  clustering methods . Multi-objective  evolutionary algorithms  (MOEAs), which determines  k  value adaptively, have been widely adopted for clustering. However, when the range of  k  becomes increasingly large,  Pareto Front  (PF)  approximations  obtained by an MOEA may not be uniformly distributed, leading to the difficulty of obtaining the optimal  k  value for clustering. For this reason, an MOEA  base  on constrained decomposition with grids (CCDG-K) is designed for clustering and better identify the optimal  k  value. CCDG-K adopts a  grid system  for decomposition. The  grid system  has an inherent property of reserving diversely populated solutions, which is very desirable for clustering. The experimental studies show that CCDG-K can deliver solutions of all  k  values which is of great help for obtaining the optimal  k  value. The experimental results also indicate that CCDG-K outperforms other algorithms in clustering.",
