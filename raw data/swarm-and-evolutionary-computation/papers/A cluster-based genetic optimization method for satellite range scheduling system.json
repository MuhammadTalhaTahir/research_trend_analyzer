    "title": "A cluster-based genetic optimization method for satellite range scheduling system",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the satellite industry, how to effectively manage satellites has become an essential issue for ground operation management. By using the k-means  clustering method , a cluster-based  genetic algorithm  (C-BGA) is proposed for the satellite ranging scheduling problem (SRSP). In the C-BGA, a heuristic-based population initialization strategy and a cluster-based evolution strategy are designed for searching for an ideal solution. Four heuristic rules were used in the initial population generation process. Population evolution process is accomplished by cluster-based crossover and mutation. These strategies also improve the algorithmâ€™s adaptability to cope with different scenarios. To increase the possibility of the task being successfully scheduled, a task arrangement algorithm (TAA) is used to generate task execution plans. Experiments are carried out to prove that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the SRSP problem.",
