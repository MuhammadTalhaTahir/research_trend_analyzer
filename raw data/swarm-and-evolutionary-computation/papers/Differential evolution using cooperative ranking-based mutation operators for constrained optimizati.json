    "title": "Differential evolution using cooperative ranking-based mutation operators for constrained optimization",
    "abstract": "Differential evolution (DE) is a widely used  heuristic algorithm  for  numerical optimization  over continuous space. As the core operator, the  mutation operator  has a great effect on DE's performance. In this paper, we propose a cooperative ranking-based mutation strategy (CRM) for DE when solving constrained  optimization problems  (COPs). In CRM, two different ranking criteria are adopted in a cooperative way to move the population towards a feasible  global optimum  with a faster convergence speed. The first criterion is objective function value-based criterion which is applied for  feasible solutions  to converge towards the global optimum. The second criterion is overall constraint violation-based criterion which is applied for infeasible solutions to search for  feasible regions . The proposed CRM is integrated into the basic DE and two advanced DE variants. The comparison results showed that the DE variants with CRM have a faster convergence speed than the non-CRM-based variants in the majority of test problems. This approach is a promising strategy to improve the search ability of DE variants when solving COPs.",
