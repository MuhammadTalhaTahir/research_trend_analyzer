    "title": "Soccer league competition algorithm for solving knapsack problems",
    "abstract": "Soccer league competition (SLC) algorithm, is a new meta-heuristic optimization technique and has been successfully used to tackle the  optimization problems  in discrete or continuous space. Fundamental ideas of SLC are inspired by a professional soccer leagues and based on the competitions among teams and players. Population individuals or players are in two types: fixed players and substitutes that all together form some teams. The competition among teams to take the possession of the top ranked positions in the league table and the internal competitions between players in each team for personal improvements are used for simulation purpose and convergence of the population individuals to the  global optimum . In this study, an enhanced SLC algorithm is proposed to solve  knapsack problems  effectively. This new version is free and independent from adjusting the parameters. The experimental results on the some benchmark  knapsack problems  demonstrate that the proposed SLC is efficient and effective, which outperforms the other algorithms, in terms of the search accuracy, reliability and convergence speed.",
