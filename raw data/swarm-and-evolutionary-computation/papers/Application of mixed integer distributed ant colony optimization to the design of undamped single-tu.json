    "title": "Application of mixed integer distributed ant colony optimization to the design of undamped single-tuned passive filters based harmonics mitigation",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to find the optimum sizing parameters of the undamped single tuned filter in the nonsinusoidal system by using a new method called Mixed Integer Distributed  Ant Colony Optimization . The inductance and capacitance values of the filter are obtained for each criterion where the power factor is maximized, the losses power in Thevenin's resistor is minimized or the transmission efficiency is maximized complying with the technical and practical constraints based on IEEE Std. 519-2014 and IEEE Std. 18-2012. A detailed study has been performed and discussed where global minimum and maximum are achieved after considering the loads being nonlinear, the value of the filter that would introduce resonance,  voltage total harmonic distortion , the consequence of the Thevenin's impedance on the  load voltage  and the practical values of the capacitor. The obtained optimum value of a single tuned filter is used to explain the  system performance  by evaluating other functions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by comparison with previous publication and other evolutionary computation techniques which are  genetic algorithm  and  particle swarm optimization .",
