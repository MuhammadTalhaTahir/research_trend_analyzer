    "title": "Adaptive filtering of EEG/ERP through noise cancellers using an improved PSO algorithm",
    "abstract": "In this paper, event related potential (ERP) generated due to hand movement is detected through the adaptive noise canceller (ANC) from the  electroencephalogram  (EEG) signals. ANCs are implemented with  least mean square  (LMS), normalized least mean square (NLMS), recursive  least square  (RLS) and  evolutionary algorithms  like  particle swarm optimization  (PSO), bacteria foraging optimization (BFO) techniques,  genetic algorithm  (GA) and artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization technique. Performance of this algorithm is evaluated in terms of  signal to noise ratio  (SNR) in dB, correlation between resultant and  template  ERP, and mean value. Testing of their  noise attenuation  capability is done on EEG contaminated with white noise at different SNR levels. A comparative study of the performance of conventional gradient based methods like LMS, NLMS and RLS, and  swarm intelligence  based PSO, BFO, GA and ABC techniques is made which reveals that PSO technique gives better performance in average cases of  noisy environment  with minimum computational complexity.",
