    "title": "Prediction based mean-variance model for constrained portfolio assets selection using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel prediction based mean-variance (PBMV) model has been proposed, as an alternative to the conventional Markowitz mean-variance model, to solve the constrained portfolio  optimization problem . In the Markowitz mean-variance model, the expected future return is taken as the mean of the past returns, which is incorrect. In the proposed model, first the expected future returns are predicted, using a low complexity heuristic functional link  artificial neural network  (HFLANN) model and the portfolio  optimization task  is carried out by using multi-objective  evolutionary algorithms  (MOEAs). In this paper,  swarm intelligence  based,  multiobjective optimization  algorithm, namely self-regulating multiobjective  particle swarm optimization  (SR-MOPSO) has also been proposed and employed efficiently to solve this important problem. The  Pareto solutions  obtained by applying two other competitive MOEAs and using the proposed PBMV models and Markowitz mean-variance model have been compared, considering six performance metrics and the  Pareto fronts . Moreover, in the present study, the nonparametric statistical analysis using the Sign test and Wilcoxon  rank test  are also carried out, to compare the performance of the algorithms pair wise. It is observed that, the proposed PBMV model based approach provides better  Pareto solutions , maintaining adequate diversity, and also quite comparable to the Markowitz model. From the simulation result, it is observed that the  self regulating  multiobjective  particle swarm optimization  (SR-MOPSO) algorithm based on PBMV model, provides the best Pareto solutions amongst those offered by other MOEAs.",
