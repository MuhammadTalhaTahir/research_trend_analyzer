    "title": "A local cooperative approach to solve large-scale constrained optimization problems",
    "abstract": "Cooperative Co-evolutionary algorithms are very popular to solve large-scale problems. A significant part of these algorithms is the decomposition of the problems according to the  variables interaction . In this paper, an approach based on a memetic scheme, where its local stage (and not the global stage) is guided by the  decomposition method  (Local Cooperative Search LoCoS), is presented to solve large-scale  constrained optimization  problems. Two decomposition methods are tested: the improved version of the Variable Interdependence Identification for Constrained problems and Differential Grouping version 2. A recently-proposed benchmark with eighteen test problems with different features is solved to assess the performance of LoCoS when compared against a similar memetic algorithm but without decomposition and also against a state-of-the-art cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm. The results show a faster convergence, better  final results  and higher feasibility ratio by LoCosS with respect to the values provided by the compared algorithms.",
