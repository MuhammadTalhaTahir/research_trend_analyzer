    "title": "On maximizing reliability of grid transaction processing system considering balanced task allocation using social spider optimization",
    "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of task allocation in the grid transaction processing system. There has been quite some research on the development of tools and techniques for grid computing systems, yet some important issues, e.g., service reliability with load balanced transaction allocation in grid computing system, have not been sufficiently studied. Load balanced transaction allocation becomes a challenging job in such a complex and dynamic environment as both the application and computational resources are heterogeneous. The problem is further complicated by the fact that these resources may fail at any point of time. The problem of finding an optimal task allocation solution is known to be an NP-hard. We propose grid transaction allocation based on social spider optimization (LBGTA_SSO) method for this problem. The LBGTA_SSO is based on the cooperative behavior of social spiders to find a collection of task allocation solutions. We also derive reliability formulae for grid transactions considering resource availability. For comparison we modify some existing algorithms to obtain the task allocation algorithms. The results show that our algorithm works better than the modified existing algorithms.",
