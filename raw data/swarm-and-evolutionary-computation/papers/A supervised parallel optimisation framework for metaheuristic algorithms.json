    "title": "A supervised parallel optimisation framework for metaheuristic algorithms",
    "abstract": "A Supervised Parallel Optimisation (SPO) is presented. The proposed framework couples different optimisation algorithms to solve single-objective optimisation problems. The supervision balances the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the distinct optimisers included, providing a general framework to solve problems with diverse characteristics. In this work, five optimisation algorithms are included in the ensemble: Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Covariance Matrix Adaption-Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), Differential Evolution (DE), and Modified Cuckoo Search (MCS). A geometric path-finding problem with numerous local minima is used to demonstrate the advantage of SPO. The effectiveness of the approach is compared with that of stand-alone incidences of the integrated optimisation strategies and with state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, a benchmark test suit composed of engineering applications is utilised to validate the general applicability of SPO with respect to a variety of problems. The good solutions generated by SPO are shown to be generally reproducible, while isolated algorithms, at best, render good solutions only occasionally.",
