    "title": "Local search based hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm for multiobjective optimization",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a hybrid multiobjective  evolutionary algorithm  combining two heuristic optimization techniques. Our approach integrates the merits of both  genetic algorithm  (GA) and  particle swarm optimization  (PSO), and has two characteristic features. Firstly, the algorithm is initialized by a set of random particles which is flown through the  search space . In order to get approximate  nondominated solutions  PND, an evolution of this particle is performed. Secondly, the local search (LS) scheme is implemented as a neighborhood search engine to improve the solution quality, where it intends to explore the less-crowded area in the current archive to possibly obtain more nondominated solutions. Finally, various kinds of multiobjective (MO) benchmark problems including the set of benchmark functions provided for CEC09 have been reported to stress the importance of hybridization algorithms in generating  Pareto optimal sets  for  multiobjective optimization problems .",
