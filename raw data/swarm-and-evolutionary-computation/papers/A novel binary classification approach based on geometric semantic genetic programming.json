    "title": "A novel binary classification approach based on geometric semantic genetic programming",
    "abstract": "Geometric semantic  genetic programming  (GSGP) is a recent variant of genetic programming. GSGP allows the landscape of any supervised  regression problem  to be transformed into a unimodal error surface, thus it has been applied only to this kind of problem. In a previous paper, we presented a novel variant of GSGP for  binary classification  problems that, taking inspiration from  perceptron   neural networks , uses a logistic-based  activation function  to constrain the output value of a GSGP tree in the interval [0,1]. This simple approach allowed us to use the standard  RMSE  function to evaluate the train  classification error  on  binary classification  problems and, consequently, to preserve the  intrinsic properties  of the geometric semantic operators. The results encouraged us to investigate this approach further. To this aim, in this paper, we present the results from 18 test problems, which we compared with those achieved by eleven well-known and widely  classification schemes . We also studied how the parameter settings affect the classification performance and the use of the  F -score function to deal with  imbalanced data . The results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
