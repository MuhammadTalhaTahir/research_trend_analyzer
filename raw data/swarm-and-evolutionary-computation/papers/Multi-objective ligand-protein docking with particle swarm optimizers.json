    "title": "Multi-objective ligand-protein docking with particle swarm optimizers",
    "abstract": "In the last years, particle swarm optimizers have emerged as prominent search methods to solve the  molecular docking  problem. A new approach to address this problem consists in a multi-objective formulation, minimizing the intermolecular energy and the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between the atom coordinates of the co-crystallized and the predicted ligand conformations. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a set of multi-objective particle swarm optimization variants based on different archiving and leader selection strategies, in the scope of molecular docking. The conducted experiments involve a large set of 75 molecular instances from the  Protein Data Bank  database (PDB) characterized by different sizes of HIV-protease inhibitors. The main motivation is to provide molecular biologists with unbiased conclusions concerning which algorithmic variant should be used in  drug discovery . Our study confirms that the multi-objective particle swarm algorithms SMPSOhv and MPSO/D show the best overall performance. An analysis of the resulting molecular ligand conformations, in terms of  binding site  and  molecular interactions , is also performed to validate the solutions found, from a biological point of view.",
