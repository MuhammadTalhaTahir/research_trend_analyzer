    "title": "A modified Intellects-Masses Optimizer for solving real-world optimization problems",
    "abstract": "The Intellects-Masses Optimizer (IMO) is a recently-proposed cultural algorithm, which is easy to understand, use, and implement. IMO requires (almost) no parameter tuning and has successfully been used to tackle unconstrained continuous optimization problems. A modified variant of IMO, called MIMO, is proposed in this paper. The proposed method uses improved update equations, a self-adaptive scaling factor, duplicates removal, and a local search to improve the performance of IMO. The MIMO method is tested on the 22 IEEE CEC 2011 real-world benchmark problems and is compared with 14  state-of-the-art  algorithms. The results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed method and its superiority compared to the original IMO algorithm.",
