    "title": "Two metaheuristics for routing and spectrum allocation in cloud-ready survivable elastic optical networks",
    "abstract": "Contemporary society relies on fast and reliable transfer of information, leading to ever-increasing size of transmitted data that stimulates the development of new algorithms for network management and optimization. This paper covers problem of allocating three types of network flows (unicast, anycast, multicast) in  elastic optical network  that implements dedicated path protection. The problem answers some users expectations such as efficient realization of cloud- and content-related services (by means of three flow types) and provision of network  survivability . The problem is modelled as an  integer linear programming  with respect to two  optimization criteria  related to the  spectrum usage . Next,  solution algorithms  are proposed which include, among others, two  metaheuristics  based on  particle swarm optimization  and  tabu search . The results of simulations evaluate efficiency of the algorithms and prove that the proposed tabu search approach significantly outperforms other methods.",
