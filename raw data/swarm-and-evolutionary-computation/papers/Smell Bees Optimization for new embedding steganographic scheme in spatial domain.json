    "title": "Smell Bees Optimization for new embedding steganographic scheme in spatial domain",
    "abstract": "In this work, we are interested in the steganography domain where the problem of security represents the basic key in the dissimulation of relevant information. The paper highlights two facets of research. The first facet represents a novel proposition of a naturally-inspired  metaheuristic  based on the smell sense of a honeybee insect. Herein, the collective  foraging behavior  is not explicitly intended but the search driven by smell sense is critical. The second facet highlights the proposition of two steganographic embedding schemes. The main idea behind the 2-Bit embedding scheme focus on the  embedding rate  of two secret bits by pixel. Compared to other  steganographic algorithms , the intended bit that will support the elementary  secret information  can be anyone in the pixel byte provided that its content matches with the secret bit to embed. The proposed steganographic algorithm named HIBE takes advantage from transform domain since it presents more robustness against  image processing  attacks. And eventually, takes advantage from spatial domain since the lower distortion results achieved in comparison with other well-knew algorithm like HUGO, and WOW gives it more efficiency. Moreover, to evaluate its performance against steganalyzers methods based  machine learning  and classifiers some experiments were carried out on the BOSSbase dataset images. The reached results have shown that the used detectors, also well-knew, failed to classify the learned images as stego since their achieved detection accuracies approaches the random detection.",
