    "title": "Cooperative coevolutionary multi-guide particle swarm optimization algorithm for large-scale multi-objective optimization problems",
    "abstract": "Many problems that are encountered in real-life applications consist of two or three conflicting objectives and many decision variables. Multi-guide  particle swarm optimization  (MGPSO) is a novel meta-heuristic for multi-objective optimization based on  particle swarm optimization  (PSO). MGPSO has been shown to be competitive when compared with other state-of-the-art multi-objective  optimization algorithms  for low-dimensional (and even many-objective) problems. However, a recent study has shown that MGPSO does not scale well when the number of decision variables is increased. This paper proposes a new scalable MGPSO-based algorithm, termed cooperative coevolutionary multi-guide  particle swarm optimization  (CCMGPSO), that incorporates ideas from cooperative  coevolution  (CC). CCMGPSO uses new techniques to spend less computational budget by periodically assigning only one CC-based subswarm to each objective (as opposed to using numerous CC-based subswarms). A detailed empirical study on well-known benchmark problems comparing the CCMGPSO with various state-of-the-art large-scale multi-objective optimization algorithms is done. Results show that the proposed CCMGPSO is highly competitive for high-dimensional problems with reference to the inverted generational distance (IGD) metric.",
