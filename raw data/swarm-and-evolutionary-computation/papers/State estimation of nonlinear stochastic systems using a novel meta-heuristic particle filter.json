    "title": "State estimation of nonlinear stochastic systems using a novel meta-heuristic particle filter",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new version of the particle filtering (PF) algorithm based on the invasive weed optimization (IWO) method. The sub-optimality of the sampling step in the PF algorithm is prone to estimation errors. In order to avert such approximation errors, this paper suggests applying the IWO algorithm by  translating  the sampling step into a  nonlinear optimization  problem. By introducing an appropriate fitness function, the optimization problem is properly treated. The validity of the proposed method is evaluated against three distinct examples: the stochastic volatility estimation problem in  finance , the severely nonlinear  waste water sludge  treatment plant, and the benchmark  target tracking  on re-entry problem. By simulation analysis and evaluation, it is verified that applying the suggested IWO enhanced PF algorithm (PFIWO) would contribute to significant estimation performance improvements.",
