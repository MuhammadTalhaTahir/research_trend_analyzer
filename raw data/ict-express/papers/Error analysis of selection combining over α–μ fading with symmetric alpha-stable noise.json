    "title": "Error analysis of selection combining over α–μ fading with symmetric alpha-stable noise",
    "abstract": "In this paper, error performance of a communication link subjected to a non-Gaussian noise model known as symmetric alpha-stable (S α S) noise and  α − μ  fading environment is analyzed with selection combining at the receiver. To this end, using binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), closed-form expressions of exact and asymptotic bit-error-rate (BER) are obtained. Furthermore, closed-form expressions of outage probability and  n -th moment are obtained. From the  n -th moment, the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel quality estimation index (CQEI) are calculated. The effect of the number of antennas ( L ) and the fading parameters on the BER is studied for different impulsive settings. Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to validate the derived results.",
