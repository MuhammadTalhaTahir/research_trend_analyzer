    "title": "Reduction of peak-to-average power ratio for FBMC/OQAM signals under the general linear non-symmetrical companding transform with a Laplace distribution",
    "abstract": "The filter bank multi-carrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM) is extensively utilized in communication scenarios characterized by severe Doppler interference, owing its remarkable ability for precise time–frequency positioning concentration. However, the distinctive staggered superposition structure leads to an additional increase in peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this letter, we discover that the unique superposition structure results in a high likelihood of abnormal minima in FBMC/OQAM, consequently diminishing the efficacy of the general companding transform scheme relying on Gaussian distribution for PAPR reduction. Thus, we introduce a general companding transform scheme based on the Laplace distribution. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme offers a 3 dB advantage in PAPR reduction compared to the traditional general companding scheme, while also maintaining a nearly 1 dB advantage in BER.",
