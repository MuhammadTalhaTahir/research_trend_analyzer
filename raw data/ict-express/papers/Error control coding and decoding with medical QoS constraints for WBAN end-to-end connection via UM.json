    "title": "Error control coding and decoding with medical QoS constraints for WBAN end-to-end connection via UMTS channel",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a reliable channel for medical uses via a physical layer to serve medical data transmission from the WBAN through the UMTS. This study focuses on applying the coding theory for high reliability and robustness to satisfy various QoS requirements of medical data. The aim is to build the Medical Network Channel that transmits WBAN medical data through the UMTS. The design of an extra channel coding is considered as a concatenated technique. The method applies an adaptive outer code with an inner UMTS code. The QoS accomplishment is investigated with numerical results proven under the AWGN and Rayleigh fading.",
