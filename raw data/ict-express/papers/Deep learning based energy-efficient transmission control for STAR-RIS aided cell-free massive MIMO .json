    "title": "Deep learning based energy-efficient transmission control for STAR-RIS aided cell-free massive MIMO networks",
    "abstract": "Recently, the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been gaining attention as a key enabler for sixth-generation networks, providing additional links with reduction in power consumption. This paper investigates the STAR-RISâ€™s potential in a cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network, where distributed APs serve user over the same time/frequency. We propose a deep deterministic policy gradient framework satisfying system-specific and per-user spectral efficiency constraints, exploiting a post-normalization and a penalized reward. From the simulations, it is revealed the proposed algorithm provides better energy performance than benchmarks, highlighting the benefits of STAR-RIS in the CF network.",
