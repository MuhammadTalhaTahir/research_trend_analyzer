    "title": "Dual-band pattern reconfigurable antenna for wireless MIMO applications",
    "abstract": "In this study, a dual-band pattern reconfigurable antenna is proposed for 2.4 and 5.8 GHz wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) applications. The proposed antenna comprises four pairs of active elements and parasitic elements loaded on PIN diodes. By switching PIN diodes, the parasitic element acts as a director or reflector, and the radiation patterns of the antenna are optimized. The antenna offers three modes with nine radiation beam patterns in a 5.8 GHz band. The measured peak gain of all the beam patterns ranges from 5.6 to 10.4 dBi. At a 2.4 GHz band, omnidirectional beam patterns with a measured peak gain of approximately 4.5 dBi are generated.",
