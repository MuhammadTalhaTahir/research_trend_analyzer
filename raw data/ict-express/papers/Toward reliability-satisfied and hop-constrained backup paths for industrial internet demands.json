    "title": "Toward reliability-satisfied and hop-constrained backup paths for industrial internet demands",
    "abstract": "Industrial data transfer must rapidly recover from possible link failures to ensure reliability. The backup path mechanism is one of the transfer protections against multiple link failures. In this paper, we study a reliability-satisfied and hop-constrained backup path model that strives to reduce network capacity consumption under constraints on the reliability and maximum hop number of the backup path. The constraint on the maximum hop number is used to ensure the reliability and delay of a backup path. We propose an approximation algorithm to solve the dynamic backup path arrangement problem that is NP-hard.",
