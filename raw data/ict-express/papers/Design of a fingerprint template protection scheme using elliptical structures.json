    "title": "Design of a fingerprint template protection scheme using elliptical structures",
    "abstract": "Although biometric authentication is viewed as more prominent than password or token-based methodology in identity verification, biometric templates are vulnerable to attacks. This paper proposes a new approach for securing fingerprint templates using elliptical structures generated from the fingerprint minutiae. Authors generate a feature vector from the ellipse and will be projected onto a 3D-space to compute a binary string. The resultant binary string is transformed to frequency domain (DFT) and multiplied with a user specific random matrix to make it permanently non-invertible and secure. The results show the efficacy of the proposed method for protecting the fingerprints.",
