    "title": "Sum rates of asynchronous GFDMA and SC-FDMA for 5G uplink",
    "abstract": "The fifth generation (5G) of mobile communication envisions ultralow latency less than 1 ms for radio interface. To this end, frameless asynchronous multiple access may be needed to allow users to transmit instantly without waiting for the next frame start. In this paper, generalized frequency division multiple-access (GFDMA), one of the promising multiple-access candidates for 5G mobile, is compared with the conventional single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) in terms of the uplink sum rate when both techniques are adapted for the asynchronous scenario. In particular, a waveform windowing technique is applied to both schemes to mitigate the inter-user interference due to non-zero out-of-band emission.",
