    "title": "Wearable anger-monitoring system",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, emotion detection based on the physiological changes of the body is a major concern. Anger is one of the most destructive emotional states and needs continuous monitoring for a healthy lifestyle. In this study, we developed and implemented a wearable anger-monitoring system, which analyses various physiological changes during the state of anger in humans and notifies the monitoring unit using a global system for mobile communication. This is unique as it detects the human mood swing and realizes it on hardware. The developed low-cost noninvasive wrist band can be used all-day and anywhere for detecting anger.",
