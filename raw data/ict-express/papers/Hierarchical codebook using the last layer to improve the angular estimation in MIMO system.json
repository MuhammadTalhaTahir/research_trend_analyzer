    "title": "Hierarchical codebook using the last layer to improve the angular estimation in MIMO system",
    "abstract": "The use of hierarchical codebooks in radio communication is of great interest today. However, using this codebook in transmitters and receivers in real-world transmission environments is a challenge nowadays because it is only suitable for discrete transmission directions. Therefore, the problem is to propose a discrete transmission model with a limited number of physical paths (virtual models), which is typical for the actual environment with many obstacles. The proposed use of hierarchical codebook in combination with the above virtual model can be compared with other traditional beamforming models applied to this model. The Success Detection Rate can be improved by this use of hierarchical codebook.",
