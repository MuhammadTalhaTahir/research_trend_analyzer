    "title": "Improving emergency response in the era of ADAS vehicles in the Smart City",
    "abstract": "Management of emergency vehicles can be fostered within a Smart City, i.e. an urban environment in which many IoT devices are orchestrated by a distributed intelligence able to suggest to road users the best course of action in different traffic situations. By extending MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation Software), we design and test appropriate mitigation strategies when traffic accidents occur within an existing urban area augmented with V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle), V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) capabilities and Advanced Driving Assisted cars (ADAS). Further, we propose traffic congestion models and related mechanisms for improving the necessary time for emergency vehicles to respond to accidents.",
