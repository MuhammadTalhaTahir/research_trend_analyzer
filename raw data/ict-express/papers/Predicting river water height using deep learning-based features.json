    "title": "Predicting river water height using deep learning-based features",
    "abstract": "The paper presents the river height prediction model using real-world historical sensor data such as rainfall, cumulative rainfall, and river water heights. The study evaluates using a Support Vector Regression, a Long Short-Term Memory, and a combination of a Long Short-Term Memory as the feature extraction and a support vector regression. Through experiments, various future predictions are tested, including a few hours or a day. As expected, RNN achieved the lowest error, but it could not capture rapid changes in river height levels. In comparison, the LSTM-SVR can better represent rapid transient changes in the data by using nonlinear kernels.",
