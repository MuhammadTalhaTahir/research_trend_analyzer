    "title": "A novel root-index based prioritized random access scheme for 5G cellular networks",
    "abstract": "Cellular networks will play an important role in realizing the newly emerging Internet-of-Everything (IoE). One of the challenging issues is to support the quality of service (QoS) during the access phase, while accommodating a massive number of machine nodes. In this paper, we show a new paradigm of multiple access priorities in random access (RA) procedure and propose a novel root-index based prioritized random access (RIPRA) scheme that  implicitly embeds the access priority in the root index of the RA preambles . The performance evaluation shows that the proposed RIPRA scheme can successfully support differentiated performance for different access priority levels, even though there exist a massive number of machine nodes.",
