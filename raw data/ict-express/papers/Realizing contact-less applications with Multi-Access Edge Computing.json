    "title": "Realizing contact-less applications with Multi-Access Edge Computing",
    "abstract": "The entire world progression has ceased with the unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and urges the requirement for contact-less and autonomous services and applications. Realizing these predominantly Internet of Things (IoT) based applications demands a holistic pervasive computing infrastructure. In this paper, we conduct a survey to determine the possible pervasive approaches for utilizing the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure in realizing the requirements of emerging IoT applications. We have formalized specific architectural layouts for the considered IoT applications, while specifying network-level requirements to realize such approaches; and conducted a simulation to test the feasibility of proposed MEC approaches.",
