    "title": "Adaptive beamforming scheme for coexistence of 5G base station and radar altimeter",
    "abstract": "In this paper, an adaptive beamforming protection scheme is proposed to enable the coexistence between radar altimeter operating in 4.2 to 4.4 GHz and potential 5G cellular services in 3.7â€“ 4.0 GHz. The proposed scheme aims to design the adaptive beamformer capable of eliminating sidelobes directed skywards, where the weights are adaptively changed according to dynamic environment. To accurately simulate the received signal at the radar altimeter, the radar altimeter system, 5G base stations, communication channels, and the propagation environment are modelled. The simulation results describe that the altitudes of the airplane are accurately measured by the proposed scheme.",
