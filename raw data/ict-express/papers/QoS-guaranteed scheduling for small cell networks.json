    "title": "QoS-guaranteed scheduling for small cell networks",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a QoS-guaranteed scheduling algorithm that considers the available resources and traffic load of small cell. Even though the available resources are scarce or traffics to be scheduled are overloaded, Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) traffic such as VoIP and video should be supported. The proposed algorithm provides a flexible weight ratio between GBR and Non-GBR traffic according to resources and traffic load. Furthermore, since QoS is considered by simple QoS Class Identifier (QCI), low complexity is achieved. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves QoS including delay and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) performance effectively.",
