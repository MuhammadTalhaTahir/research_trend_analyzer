    "title": "A lightweight authentication and privacy-preserving scheme for VANETs using TESLA and Bloom Filters",
    "abstract": "In Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), broadcasted beacon messages are critical as most safety applications rely on them. However, the design of a secure broadcast authentication faces many security and privacy challenges as vehicles are vulnerable to active attacks and the revealing of location. In this paper, we propose a lightweight authentication scheme using Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) scheme and Bloom Filters that not only prevents active attacks but also adds a privacy-preserving feature to make the scheme have better performance. Simulation results indicate the scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of verification time and the level of anonymity.",
