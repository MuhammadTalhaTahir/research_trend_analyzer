    "abstract": "Sentiment Analysis of Malayalam Tweets using Machine Learning techniques is done in this paper. The tweets are classified into positive and negative using different machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The different features like Bag of Words (BOW), Term Frequency vs. Inverse Document Frequency (TF  âˆ’  IDF), Unigram with Sentiwordnet, and Unigram with Sentiwordnet including negation words are considered for feature vector formation of input dataset. The Random Forest classifier shows higher accuracy while considering Unigram with Sentiwordnet including negation words as a feature.",
