    "title": "Review of capacitive coupling human body communications based on digital transmission",
    "abstract": "Human body communications (HBC) have been studied as an enabling technology to meet the recently increased demands for low-power and high-simplicity in wireless body area networks for wearable-device applications. Previous works on HBC focused mainly on channel modeling with a measurement method, signal transmission scheme, and transceiver implementation. In particular, the digital transmission, invented as a customized approach for the human body channel, has contributed to develope low-complexity HBC systems. This paper addresses on-going research on capacitive coupling HBC based on digital transmission by exploring recent literature.",
