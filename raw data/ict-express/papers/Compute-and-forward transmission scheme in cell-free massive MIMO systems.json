    "title": "Compute-and-forward transmission scheme in cell-free massive MIMO systems",
    "abstract": "Cell-free massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems comprise a large number of distributed access points (APs) to serve a small number of user equipments (UEs). In this paper, compute-and-forward (CF) is investigated for uplink in cell-free massive MIMO. We propose a novel reverse CF precoding scheme for downlink transmission for cell-free massive MIMO. The APs send the linear equations of messages over a multiple access channel, and the UEs recover messages without interferences. The maxâ€“min power allocation is investigated to provide uniformly good service to all UEs. Numeral results demonstrate the performance improvement provided by the proposed reverse CF precoder against zero-forcing, conjugate beamforming, and linear minimum mean-square error precoder.",
