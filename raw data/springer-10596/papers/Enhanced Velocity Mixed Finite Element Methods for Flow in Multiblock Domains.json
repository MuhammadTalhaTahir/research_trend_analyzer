    "title": "Enhanced Velocity Mixed Finite Element Methods for Flow in Multiblock Domains",
    "abstract": "The paper presents a new approach to discretizing flow in porous media via mixed finite element methods on non-matching multiblock grids. The velocity space along the interfaces is enhanced to give flux-continuous approximation. No additional matching conditions need to be imposed. The computational complexity of the resulting algebraic problem is comparable to the one for the single-block case. A priori error estimates for the pressure and the velocity and numerical experiments confirming the theory are presented.",
