    "title": "Consistent prediction of well paths and geological surfaces",
    "abstract": "We propose a smooth stochastic process for modeling the vertical well path uncertainty. This process describes the accumulation of measurement errors along the well path. We combine the stochastic process with a stochastic model for surfaces into a consistent framework for simultaneous prediction of well paths and surfaces. We show properties of the proposed stochastic process and provide examples of interaction between wells and surfaces.",
