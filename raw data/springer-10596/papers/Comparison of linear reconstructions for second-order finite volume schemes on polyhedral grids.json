    "title": "Comparison of linear reconstructions for second-order finite volume schemes on polyhedral grids",
    "abstract": "Improved and enhanced oil recovery methods require sophisticated simulation tools to predict the injected flow pass together with the chemical reactions inside it. One approach is application of higher-order numerical schemes to avoid excessive numerical diffusion that is very typical for transport processes. In this work, we provide a first step towards higher-order schemes applicable on general polyhedral and corner-point grids typically used in reservoir simulation. We compare three possible approaches of linear reconstruction and slope limiting techniques on a variety of different meshes in two and three spatial dimensions and discuss advantages and disadvantages.",
