    "title": "Large-scale stochastic linear inversion using hierarchical matrices",
    "abstract": "Stochastic inverse modeling deals with the estimation of functions from sparse data, which is a problem with a nonunique solution, with the objective to evaluate best estimates, measures of uncertainty, and sets of solutions that are consistent with the data. As finer resolutions become desirable, the computational requirements increase dramatically when using conventional solvers. A method is developed in this paper to solve large-scale stochastic linear inverse problems, based on the hierarchical matrix (or â„‹ 2 matrix) approach. The proposed approach can also exploit the sparsity of the underlying measurement operator, which relates observations to unknowns. Conventional direct algorithms for solving large-scale linear inverse problems, using stochastic linear inversion techniques, typically scale as ",
