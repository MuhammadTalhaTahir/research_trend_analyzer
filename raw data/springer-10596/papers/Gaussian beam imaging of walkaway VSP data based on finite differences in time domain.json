    "title": "Gaussian beam imaging of walkaway VSP data based on finite differences in time domain",
    "abstract": "The approach to true amplitude seismic imaging for walkaway vertical seismic profile multicomponent data is presented and discussed. This approach is a migration procedure based on weighted summation of pre-stack data. True amplitude weights are computed with application of Gaussian beams. Gaussian beams are computed in time domain via finite-difference modeling. Numerical experiments with synthetic data generated for realistic salt model are presented and discussed.",
