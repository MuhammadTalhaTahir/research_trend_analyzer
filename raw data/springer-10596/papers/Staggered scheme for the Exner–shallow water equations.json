    "title": "Staggered scheme for the Exner–shallow water equations",
    "abstract": "The staggered numerical scheme is shown to be a robust and simple method for the approximation of the Exner–shallow water equations for bedload sediment modeling. Numerical tests show good convergence properties to an analytical solution and match pretty well data experiments in the case of dam break with erodible bottom. The cases of subcritical steady flow over a bump and transcritical flow over a bump are presented, showing the robustness of the scheme and its interest for engineering applications.",
