    "title": "Multi-Parameter Identification and Applications in Well-Logging",
    "abstract": "We deal with a multi-parameter identification problem arising in oil industry. In the general case, we give a local solvability condition to guarantee the well-posedness of the problem. We discuss in detail the identification of two parameters for which some numerical results are given.",
