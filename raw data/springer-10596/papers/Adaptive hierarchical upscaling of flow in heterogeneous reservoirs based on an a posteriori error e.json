    "title": "Adaptive hierarchical upscaling of flow in heterogeneous reservoirs based on an a posteriori error estimate",
    "abstract": "This paper treats the upscaling of the absolute permeability in a heterogeneous reservoir. By replacing the fine scale permeability tensor with an upscaled, or effective permeability tensor, a modelling error is introduced. An a posteriori error estimate on this modelling error is formulated and tested. An implementation of the theory, based on domain decomposition coupled with a hierarchical representation of the absolute permeability field, is given. As hierarchical basis functions we have chosen the Haar system, which leads to a wavelet representation of the permeability. The wavelet representation offers a natural upscaling technique which resembles the highcut filters commonly used in signal analysis. This procedure represents an adaptive upscaling method. The numerical results show that this method conserves both the dissipation and the mean velocity in the problem fairly well. The a posteriori error estimate on the modelling error coupled with domain decomposition methods constitutes a powerful modelling tool.",
