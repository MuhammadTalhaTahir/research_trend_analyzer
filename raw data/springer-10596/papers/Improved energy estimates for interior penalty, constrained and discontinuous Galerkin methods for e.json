    "title": "Improved energy estimates for interior penalty, constrained and discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic problems. Part I",
    "abstract": "Three Galerkin methods using discontinuous approximation spaces are introduced to solve elliptic problems. The underlying bilinear form for all three methods is the same and is nonsymmetric. In one case, a penalty is added to the form and in another, a constraint on jumps on each face of the triangulation. All three methods are locally conservative and the third one is not restricted. Optimal a priori hp error estimates are derived for all three procedures.",
