    "title": "Fast optical flow using 3D shortest path techniques",
    "abstract": "Optical flow or image motion estimation is important in the area of  computer vision . This paper presents a fast and reliable optical flow algorithm which produces a dense optical flow map by using fast cross correlation and 3D shortest path techniques. Fast correlation is achieved by using the box-filtering technique which is invariant to the size of the correlation window. The motion for each  scanline  or each column of the input image is obtained from the  correlation coefficient  volume by finding the best 3D path using  dynamic programming  techniques rather than simply choosing the position that gives the maximum cross  correlation coefficient . Sub-pixel accuracy is achieved by fitting the  local correlation  coefficients to a quadratic surface. Typical running time for a 256×256 image is in the order of a few seconds on a 85   MHz computer. A variety of synthetic and real images have been tested, and good results have been obtained.",
