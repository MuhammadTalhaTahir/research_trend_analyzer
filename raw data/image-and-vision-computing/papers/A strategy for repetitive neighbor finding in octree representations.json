    "title": "A strategy for repetitive neighbor finding in octree representations",
    "abstract": "An effective strategy for repetitive neighbor finding in octrees is presented. It is based on a new method which uses a  matrix representation  for octrees and some auxiliary locational codes for neighbors’ generation. This approach is universal and generates all neighbors (larger, smaller, equal) for any octree node using only simple  algebraic operations .",
