    "title": "A survey of methods, datasets and evaluation metrics for visual question answering",
    "abstract": "Visual Question Answering  (VQA) is a multi-disciplinary research problem that has captured the attention of both  computer vision  as well as  natural language processing  researchers. In Visual Question Answering, a system is given an image; a question in a natural language related to that image as an input, and the  VQA system  is required to give an answer in natural language as an output. A VQA algorithm may require  common sense  reasoning over the information contained in the image and world knowledge to produce the right answer. In this paper, we have discussed some of the core concepts used in VQA systems and present a comprehensive survey of efforts in the past to address this problem. Apart from traditional VQA models, we have also discussed visual question answering models that require reading texts present in images and evaluated on recently developed datasets like TextVQA, ST-VQA, and OCR-VQA. Apart from standard datasets discussed in previous surveys, we have also discussed some new datasets developed in 2019 and 2020 such as GQA, OK-VQA, TextVQA, ST-VQA, and OCR-VQA. The new  evaluation metrics  such as BLEU, MPT, METEOR, Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS), Validity, Plausibility, Distribution, Consistency, Grounding, F1-Score are explained together with the evaluation metrics discussed by previous surveys. We conclude our survey with a discussion on open issues in each phase of the VQA task and present some promising future directions.",
