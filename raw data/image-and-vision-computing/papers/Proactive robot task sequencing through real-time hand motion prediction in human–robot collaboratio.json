    "title": "Proactive robot task sequencing through real-time hand motion prediction in human–robot collaboration",
    "abstract": "Human–robot collaboration (HRC) is essential for improving productivity and safety across various industries. While reactive motion re-planning strategies are useful, there is a growing demand for proactive methods that predict human intentions to enable more efficient collaboration. This study addresses this need by introducing a framework that combines deep learning-based human hand trajectory forecasting with heuristic optimization for robotic task sequencing. The deep learning model advances real-time hand position forecasting using a multi-task learning loss to account for both hand positions and contact delay regression, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Ego4D Future Hand Prediction benchmark. By integrating hand trajectory predictions into task planning, the framework offers a cohesive solution for HRC. To optimize task sequencing, the framework incorporates a Dynamic Variable Neighborhood Search (DynamicVNS) heuristic algorithm, which allows robots to pre-plan task sequences and avoid potential collisions with human hand positions. DynamicVNS provides significant computational advantages over the generalized VNS method. The framework was validated on a UR10e robot performing a visual inspection task in a HRC scenario, where the robot effectively anticipated and responded to human hand movements in a shared workspace. Experimental results highlight the system’s effectiveness and potential to enhance HRC in industrial settings by combining predictive accuracy and task planning efficiency.",
