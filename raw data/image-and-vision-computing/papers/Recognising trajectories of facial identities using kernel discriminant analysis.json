    "title": "Recognising trajectories of facial identities using kernel discriminant analysis",
    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive approach to address three challenging problems in  face recognition : modelling faces across multi-views, extracting the nonlinear discriminating features, and recognising moving faces dynamically in image sequences. A multi-view dynamic face model is designed to extract the  shape-and-pose-free  facial texture patterns. Kernel  discriminant analysis , which employs the kernel technique to perform linear  discriminant analysis  in a high-dimensional feature space, is developed to extract the significant  nonlinear features  which maximise the between-class variance and minimise the within-class variance. Finally, an identity surface based face recognition is performed dynamically from video input by matching object and model trajectories.",
