    "title": "DeepFH segmentations for superpixel-based object proposal refinement",
    "abstract": "Class-agnostic object proposal generation is an important first step in many object detection pipelines. However, object proposals of modern systems are rather inaccurate in terms of segmentation and only roughly adhere to object boundaries. Since typical refinement steps are usually not applicable to thousands of proposals, we propose a superpixel-based refinement system for object proposal generation systems. Utilizing precise superpixels and  superpixel  pooling on deep features, we refine initial coarse proposals in an end-to-end learned system. Furthermore, we propose a novel DeepFH segmentation, which enriches the classic Felzenszwalb and  Huttenlocher  (FH) segmentation with deep features leading to improved segmentation results and better object proposal refinements. On the COCO dataset with LVIS annotations, we show that our refinement based on DeepFH superpixels outperforms state-of-the-art methods and leads to more precise object proposals.",
