    "title": "Spatial and spectral morphological template matching",
    "abstract": "Template matching  is a very topical issue in a wide range of imaging applications.  Mathematical morphology  offers the hit-or-miss transform, an operator which has been successfully applied for template matching in  binary images . More recently, it has been extended to  grayscale images  and even to multivariate images. Nevertheless, these extensions, despite being relevant from a theoretical point-of-view, might lack practical interest due to the inherent difficulty to set up correctly the transform and its parameters (e.g. the structuring functions). In this paper, we propose a new and more intuitive operator which allows for morphological template matching in multivariate images from both a spatial and spectral point of view. We illustrate the potential of this operator in the context of  remote sensing .",
