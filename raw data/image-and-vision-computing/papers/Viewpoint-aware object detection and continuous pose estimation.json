    "title": "Viewpoint-aware object detection and continuous pose estimation",
    "abstract": "We describe an approach to category-level detection and viewpoint estimation for rigid 3D objects from single 2D images. In contrast to many existing methods, we directly integrate 3D reasoning with an appearance-based voting architecture. Our method relies on a nonparametric representation of a  joint   distribution of shape  and appearance of the object class. Our voting method employs a novel parameterization of joint detection and viewpoint hypothesis space, allowing efficient accumulation of evidence. We combine this with a re-scoring and refinement mechanism, using an ensemble of view-specific  support vector machines . We evaluate the performance of our approach in detection and pose estimation of cars on a number of benchmark datasets. Finally we introduce the “Weizmann Cars ViewPoint” (WCVP) dataset, a benchmark for evaluating continuous pose estimation.",
