    "title": "Hair detection, segmentation, and hairstyle classification in the wild",
    "abstract": "Hair highly characterises human appearance. Hair detection in images is useful for many applications, such as face and  gender recognition , video surveillance, and hair modelling. We tackle the problem of hair analysis (detection, segmentation, and hairstyle classification) from unconstrained view by relying only on textures, without a-priori information on head shape and location, nor using body-part classifiers. We first build a hair probability map by classifying overlapping patches described by features extracted from a  CNN , using  Random Forest . Then modelling hair (resp. non-hair) from high (resp. low) probability regions, we segment at  pixel level  uncertain areas by using LTP features and  SVM . For the experiments we extend  Figaro , an image database for hair detection to  Figaro1k , a new version with more than 1000 manually annotated images. Achieved  segmentation accuracy  (around 90 % ) is superior to known state-of-the-art. Images are eventually classified into hairstyle classes: straight, wavy, curly, kinky, braids, dreadlocks, and short.",
