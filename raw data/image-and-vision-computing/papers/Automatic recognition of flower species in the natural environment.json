    "title": "Automatic recognition of flower species in the natural environment",
    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a method for the recognition and retrieval of a flower species in the natural environment based on a multi-layer technique, and we also suggest novel applications. First, the study suggests how to capture a flower object that is blooming in the natural environment, as well as the corresponding background. Secondly, an experimental analysis is conducted for the purpose of improving the optimal method of feature extraction for color, texture, and shape. Thirdly, the study developed a flower-image automatic-recognition technology that can be utilized in a mobile environment. We performed experiments on 29,463 images of 300 species of blooming flowers that were collected in South Korea between 2011 and 2014. We found image recognition to be 91.26% for the 1st-ranking recognition of the flower image and 97.40% for the 6th-ranking recognition. These results show that the color–texture–shape features of the flower pictures are the most effective; furthermore, the effectiveness and validity of this suggested method for demonstration services are verified in this paper.",
