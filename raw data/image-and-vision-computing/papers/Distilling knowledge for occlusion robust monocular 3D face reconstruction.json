    "abstract": "Recently, there have been significant advancements in the 3D face reconstruction field, largely driven by monocular image-based deep learning methods. However, these methods still face challenges in reliable deployments due to their sensitivity to facial occlusions and inability to maintain identity consistency across different occlusions within the same facial image. To address these issues, we propose two frameworks:  D istillation   A ssisted   M ono   I mage   O cclusion   R obustification ( DAMIOR )  and  D uplicate   I mages   A ssisted   M ulti   O cclusions   R obustification ( DIAMOR ) . The  DAMIOR  framework leverages the knowledge from the  O cclusion   F rail   T rainer ( OFT )  network to enhance robustness against facial occlusions. Our proposed method overcomes the sensitivity to occlusions and improves reconstruction accuracy. To tackle the issue of identity inconsistency, the  DIAMOR  framework utilizes the estimates from  DAMIOR  to mitigate inconsistencies in geometry and texture, collectively known as identity, of the reconstructed 3D faces. We evaluate the performance of  DAMIOR  on two variations of the CelebA test dataset: empirical occlusions and irrational occlusions. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the proposed  DIAMOR  framework using the irrational occlusion-based variant of the CelebA test dataset. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin. For example,  DAMIOR  reduces the 3D vertex-based shape error by  41.1 %  and the texture error by  21.8 %  for empirical occlusions. Besides, for facial data with irrational occlusions, DIAMOR achieves a substantial decrease in shape error by  42.5 %  and texture error by  30.5 % . These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.",
