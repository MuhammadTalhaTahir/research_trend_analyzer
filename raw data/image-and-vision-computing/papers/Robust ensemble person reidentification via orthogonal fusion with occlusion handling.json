    "title": "Robust ensemble person reidentification via orthogonal fusion with occlusion handling",
    "abstract": "Occlusion remains one of the major challenges in person  reidentification  (ReID) due to the diversity of poses and the variation of appearances. Developing novel architectures to improve the robustness of occlusion-aware person Re-ID requires new insights, especially on low-resolution edge cameras. We propose a deep ensemble model that harnesses both  CNN  and Transformer architectures to generate robust feature representations. To achieve robust Re-ID without manually labeling occluded regions, we propose to take an ensemble learning-based approach derived from the analogy between arbitrarily shaped occluded regions and robust feature representation. Using the  orthogonality  principle, our developed  deep CNN  model uses masked  autoencoder  (MAE) and globalâ€“local  feature fusion  for robust person identification. Furthermore, we present a part occlusion-aware transformer capable of learning  feature space  that is robust to occluded regions. Experimental results are reported on several Re-ID datasets to show the effectiveness of our developed ensemble model named orthogonal fusion with occlusion handling (OFOH). Compared to competing methods, the proposed OFOH approach has achieved competent rank-1 and  mAP  performance.",
