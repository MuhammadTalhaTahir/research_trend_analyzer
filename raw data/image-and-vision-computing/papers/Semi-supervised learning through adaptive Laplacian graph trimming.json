    "title": "Semi-supervised learning through adaptive Laplacian graph trimming",
    "abstract": "Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) attracts considerable attention in recent years. The performance of a general GSSL method relies on the quality of  Laplacian   weighted graph  (LWR) composed of the similarity imposed on input examples. A key for constructing an effective LWR is on the proper selection of the neighborhood size  K  or  ε  on the construction of  KNN  graph or  ε -neighbor graph on  training samples , which constitutes the fundamental elements in LWR. Specifically, too large  K  or  ε  will result in “shortcut” phenomenon while too small ones cannot guarantee to represent a complete manifold structure underlying data. To this issue, this study attempts to propose a method, called adaptive  Laplacian  graph trimming (ALGT), to make an automatic tuning to cut improper inter-cluster shortcut edges while enhance the connection between intra-cluster samples, so as to adaptively fit a proper LWR from data. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated by experimental results implemented on synthetic and UCI data sets.",
