    "title": "Accurate traffic light detection using deep neural network with focal regression loss",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method that uses a  deep neural network  (DNN) to detect small traffic lights (TLs) in images captured by cameras mounted in vehicles. The proposed TL detector has a  DNN architecture  of encoder-decoder with focal regression loss; this loss  function reduces  loss of well-regressed easy examples. The proposed TL detector has freestyle  anchor boxes  that are placed at arbitrary locations in a  grid cell  of an input image, so it can detect small objects located at borders of the grid cell. We evaluate the proposed TL detector with a focal regression loss on two public TL datasets: Bosch small traffic light dataset, and LISA traffic lights dataset. Compared to state-of-the-art TL detectors, the proposed TL detector achieves 7.19%–42.03% higher  mAP  on the Bosch-TL dataset and 19.86%–49.16% higher AUC on the LISA-TL dataset.",
