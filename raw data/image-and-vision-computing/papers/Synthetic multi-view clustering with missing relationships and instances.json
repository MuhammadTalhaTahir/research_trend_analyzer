    "title": "Synthetic multi-view clustering with missing relationships and instances",
    "abstract": "Multi-view learning not only excavates the supplement information thoroughly, but also avoids noisy features and redundancies to improve down-stream tasks, e.g. Cluster, by constructing the fusing model. However, in practices, it is difficult to obtain complete multi-view data, which is summarized as both of  P artially  S ample-Missing  P roblem (PSP) originating from any view and  P artially  V iew-unaligned  P roblem (PVP). SURE (robust multi-view clustering with incomplete information) builds up the novel loss function to remove the noisy samples in the embedding space and presents the aligning method to solve both of PVP and PSP. However, generated instances and relationships contain relatively little discriminate information and  semantic consistency , moreover, it needs a large size of complete samples to pre-train. Aiming to above problems, we propose the novel framework (termed Synthetic Multi-view  Data Clustering , SMDC). For PSP problem, we induce feature-distillation in each feature-map level to generate features containing more semantic information helping with the guidance of complete feature-maps, furthermore, exploits self-distillation to strengthen the  discriminability  information of deeper levels supervised from the contrastive constraint in the embedding space. Moreover, for PVP problem, we leverage  attention mechanism  to adaptively fuse multi-view features and auto-align instances located in different views. The proposed model is verified in images and video  clustering tasks , respectively. Comparing with popular methods achieve satisfactory performances. The code of model is published in:  https://github.com/ LNNU-computer-research-526/SMDC.",
