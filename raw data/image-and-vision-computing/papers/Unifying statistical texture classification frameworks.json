    "title": "Unifying statistical texture classification frameworks",
    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to examine  statistical approaches  to the classification of  textured materials  from a single image obtained under unknown viewpoint and illumination. The approaches investigated here are based on the  joint probability distribution  of filter responses. We review previous work based on this formulation and make two observations. First, we show that there is a correspondence between the two common representations of filter outputsâ€”textons and binned histograms. Second, we show that two classification methodologies, nearest neighbour matching and  Bayesian classification , are equivalent for particular choices of the  distance measure . We describe the pros and cons of these alternative representations and distance measures, and illustrate the discussion by classifying all the materials in the Columbia-Utrecht (CUReT) texture database. These equivalences allow us to perform direct comparisons between the texton frequency matching framework, best exemplified by the classifiers of Leung and Malik [Int. J. Comput. Vis. 43 (2001) 29], Cula and Dana [Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on  Computer Vision  and Pattern Recognition (2001) 1041], and Varma and Zisserman [Proceedings of the Seventh European Conference on Computer Vision 3 (2002) 255], and the  Bayesian framework  most closely represented by the work of Konishi and Yuille [Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2000) 125].",
