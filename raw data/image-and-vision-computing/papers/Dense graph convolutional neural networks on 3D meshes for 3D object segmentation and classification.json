    "abstract": "This paper presents new designs of  graph convolutional neural networks  (GCNs) on 3D meshes for 3D object segmentation and classification. We use the faces of the mesh as basic processing units and represent a 3D mesh as a graph where each node corresponds to a face. To enhance the descriptive power of the graph, we introduce a 1-ring face neighborhood structure to derive novel multi-dimensional spatial and structure features to represent the  graph nodes . Based on this new  graph representation , we then design a densely  connected graph  convolutional block which aggregates local and regional features as the key construction component to build effective and efficient practical  GCN models  for 3D object classification and segmentation. We present experimental results to show that our new technique performs comparably to state of the art across a number of benchmark datasets where our models are also shown to have smaller number of parameters. We also present ablation studies to demonstrate the soundness of our design principles and the effectiveness of our practical models.",
