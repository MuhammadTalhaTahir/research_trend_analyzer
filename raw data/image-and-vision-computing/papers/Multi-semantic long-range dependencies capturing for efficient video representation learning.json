    "title": "Multi-semantic long-range dependencies capturing for efficient video representation learning",
    "abstract": "Capturing long-range dependencies has proven effective on  video understanding  tasks. However, previous works address this problem in a pixel pairs manner, which might be inaccurate since pixel pairs contain too limited semantic information. Besides, considerable computations and parameters will be introduced in those methods. Following the pattern of features aggregation in  Graph Convolutional Networks  (GCNs), we aggregate pixels with their neighbors into semantic units, which contain  stronger semantic  information than pixel pairs. We designed an efficient, parameter-free, semantic units-based dependencies capturing framework, named as Multi-semantic Long-range Dependencies Capturing (MLDC) block. We verified our methods on large-scale challenging video classification benchmark, such as Kinetics. Experiments demonstrate that our method highly outperforms pixel pairs-based methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, without introducing any parameters and much computations.",
