    "title": "Faster and finer pose estimation for multiple instance objects in a single RGB image",
    "abstract": "Determining the 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) object pose parameters for multiple instance objects with high accuracy and less time complexity is a challenging issue in robotics and  computer vision . Many bottom-up approaches have been proposed for rapid multiple pose estimation but these are much less accurate than top-down approaches. Moreover, most post-processing is affected from more detected objects because non-maximum suppression is used. This study uses a bottom-up approach that is faster and more precise to estimate poses for multiple instance objects in a single  RGB image . This method can overcome the occlusion/overlapping of instances in the same/different object category. Informative features and techniques including a semantic  segmentation map , multi-keypoint vector fields, a 3D coordinate map, and diagonal graph clustering post-processing are proposed to segment the entire mask into instance masks at once and then to estimate the corresponding poses. The experimental results and ablation studies show that the proposed system features competitive accuracy at a speed of 24.7 frames per second for more than 7 objects using the Occlusion LINEMOD dataset.",
