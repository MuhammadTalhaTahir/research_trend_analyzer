    "title": "A novel facial expression recognition algorithm using geometry β –skeleton in fusion based on deep CNN",
    "abstract": "Facial expression recognition  (FER) methods based on single-source facial data often suffer from reduced accuracy or unpredictability due to facial occlusion or illumination changes. To address this, a new technique called Fusion-CNN is proposed. It improves accuracy by extracting hybrid features using a β-skeleton  undirected graph  and an ellipse with parameters trained using a 1D-CNN. In addition, a 2D-CNN is trained on the same image. The outputs from these two  subnetworks  are fused, and their features are concatenated to create a feature vector for classification in a  deep neural network . The proposed method is evaluated on four public  face  datasets: the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK   +) dataset, the Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) dataset, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF), and Oulu-CASIA. The experimental results show that Fusion-CNN outperforms other algorithms, achieving  recognition accuracy  of 98.22%, 93.07%, 90.30%, and 90.13% for the CK   +, JAFFE, KDEF, and Oulu-CASIA datasets, respectively.",
