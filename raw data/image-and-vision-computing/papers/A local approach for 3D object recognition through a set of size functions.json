    "title": "A local approach for 3D object recognition through a set of size functions",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a local approach for 3 D  object recognition is presented. It is based on the topological invariants provided by the  critical points  of the 3 D  object. The  critical points  and the links between them are represented by a set of size functions obtained after splitting the 3 D  object into portions. A suitable similarity measure is used to compare the sets of size functions associated with the 3 D  objects. In order to validate our approach's recognition performance, we used different collections of 3 D  objects. The obtained scores are favourably comparable to the related work.",
