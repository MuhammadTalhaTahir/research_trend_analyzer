    "title": "A rule-based system for dimensional analysis of glass containers",
    "abstract": "A frame-based vision system has been developed. Frames are homogeneous containing two slots: for the data and algorithms relating to a data type. Each frame may follow forward or backward chaining search strategies or may invoke procedural code. Any frame may call upon any other frame to perform some analysis and results are returned with an assessment of the degree of certainty of the result. The degree of certainty is used by the system in assessing the conclusions reached. As an example of the system's use, dimensional analysis of glass containers has been performed.",
