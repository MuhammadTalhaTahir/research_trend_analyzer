    "title": "Co-occurrence of deep convolutional features for image search",
    "abstract": "Image search can be tackled using deep features from pre-trained  Convolutional Neural Networks  (CNN). The feature map from the last  convolutional layer  of a CNN encodes descriptive information from which a discriminative global descriptor can be obtained. We propose a new representation of  co-occurrences  from deep convolutional features to extract additional relevant information from this last convolutional layer. Combining this  co-occurrence  map with the feature map, we achieve an improved image representation. We present two different methods to get the  co-occurrence  representation, the first one based on direct aggregation of activations, and the second one, based on a trainable  co-occurrence  representation. The image descriptors derived from our methodology improve the performance in very well-known image retrieval datasets as we prove in the experiments.",
