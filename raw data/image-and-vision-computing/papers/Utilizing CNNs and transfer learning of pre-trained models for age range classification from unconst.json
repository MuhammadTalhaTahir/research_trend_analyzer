    "title": "Utilizing CNNs and transfer learning of pre-trained models for age range classification from unconstrained face images",
    "abstract": "Automatic age classification from real-world and wild face images is a challenging task and has an increasing importance due to its wide range of applications in current and future lifestyles. As a result of increasing age specific human-computer interactions, it is expected that  computerized systems  should be capable of estimating the age from face images and respond accordingly. Over the past decade, many research studies have been conducted on automatic age classification from face images. However, the performance of the developed age classification systems suffered due to the absence of large, comprehensive benchmarks. In this work, we propose and show that pre-trained  CNNs  which were trained on large benchmarks for different purposes can be retrained and fine-tuned for age range classification from unconstrained face images. Also, we propose to reduce the dimension of the output of the last  convolutional layer  in pre-trained  CNNs  to improve the performance of the designed  CNNs architectures . The experimental results show significant improvements in exact and 1-off accuracies on the Adience benchmark.",
