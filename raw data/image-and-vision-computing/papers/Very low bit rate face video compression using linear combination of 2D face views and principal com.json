    "title": "Very low bit rate face video compression using linear combination of 2D face views and principal components analysis",
    "abstract": "We present an  image synthesis  technique for very low bit rate encoding of faces for videoconferencing applications over the Internet or mobile communication networks. The proposed scheme represents each new face view as a  linear combination  of three basis face views of the same person. The background of the target face view is also encoded by the  linear combination  method using the basis views used for the face area. However, changes in the eyes and  mouth regions  cannot be encoded by the linear combination scheme. These regions are encoded using  principal components  analysis with three training sets of eyes and mouth images of the same person. The scheme results in a very  compact representation  of the face video data. Good quality images are reconstructed with an estimated bit rate varying from 1384 to 1620 Â  bits/frame.",
