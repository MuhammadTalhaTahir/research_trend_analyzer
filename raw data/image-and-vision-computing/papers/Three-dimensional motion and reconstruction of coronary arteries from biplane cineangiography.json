    "title": "Three-dimensional motion and reconstruction of coronary arteries from biplane cineangiography",
    "abstract": "A new approach is described for reconstructing coronary arteries from two sequences of projection images. The estimation of motion is performed on three-dimensional line segments (or centrelines), and is based on a ‘predictionprojection-optimization’ loop. The method copes with time varying properties, deformations and superpositions of vessels. Experiments using simulated and real data have been carried out. and the results found to be robust over a full cycle of a human heart. Local and global kinetic features can then be derived to obtain a greater insight on the cardiac functional state",
