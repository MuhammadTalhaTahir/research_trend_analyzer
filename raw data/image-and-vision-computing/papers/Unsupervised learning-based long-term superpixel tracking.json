    "title": "Unsupervised learning-based long-term superpixel tracking",
    "abstract": "Finding correspondences between structural entities decomposing images is of high interest for  computer vision applications . In particular, we analyze how to accurately track  superpixels  - visual primitives generated by aggregating  adjacent pixels  sharing similar characteristics - over  extended time periods  relying on  unsupervised learning  and temporal integration. A two-step video processing pipeline dedicated to long-term superpixel tracking is proposed. First, unsupervised learning-based superpixel matching provides correspondences between consecutive and distant frames using new context-rich features extended from greyscale to multi-channel and forward-backward consistency constraints. Resulting elementary matches are then combined along multi-step paths running through the whole sequence with various inter-frame distances. This produces a large set of candidate long-term superpixel pairings upon which majority voting is performed. Video object tracking experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our elementary estimator against state-of-the-art methods and proves the ability of multi-step integration to provide accurate long-term superpixel matches compared to usual direct and sequential integration.",
