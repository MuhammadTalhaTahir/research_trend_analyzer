    "title": "Semantics feature sampling for point-based 3D object detection",
    "abstract": "Currently,  3D object detection  is a research hotspot in the field of  computer vision . In this paper, we have observed that the commonly used set abstraction module retains excessive irrelevant  background information  during downsampling, impacting object detection precision. To address this, we propose a mixed sampling method. During point feature extraction, we integrate  semantic features  into the sampling process, guiding the set abstraction module to sample foreground points. In order to leverage the high-quality 3D proposals generated in the first stage, we have developed a virtual point pooling module aimed at acquiring the features of these proposals. This module facilitates the capture of more comprehensive and resilient ROI features. Experimental results on the KITTI test set show a 3.51% higher Average Precision (AP) compared to the PointRCNN baseline, particularly for moderately challenging car classes, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.",
