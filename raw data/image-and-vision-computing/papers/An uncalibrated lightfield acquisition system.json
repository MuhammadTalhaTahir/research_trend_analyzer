    "title": "An uncalibrated lightfield acquisition system",
    "abstract": "Acquisition of  image data  for lightfield usually requires an expensive, complex and bulky setup. In this paper, we describe a simple method of acquiring the image data set. The method requires a normal handheld video camera, which is taken around the object to be rendered. We employ  homography  from the viewing/camera plane to the lightfield plane for obtaining the  ray intersections  with the lightfield planes. The computations involved are simple and make the method suitable for online lightfield acquisition.",
