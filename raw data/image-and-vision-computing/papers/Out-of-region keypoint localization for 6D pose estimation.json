    "title": "Out-of-region keypoint localization for 6D pose estimation",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of instance level 6D pose estimation from a single  RGB image . Our approach simultaneously detects objects and recovers poses by predicting the 2D image locations of the object's 3D  bounding box  vertices. Specifically, we focus on the challenge of locating virtual  keypoints  outside the object region proposals, and propose a boundary-based keypoint representation which incorporates classification and regression schemes to reduce output space. Moreover, our method predicts localization confidences and alleviates the influence of difficult keypoints by a voting process. We implement the proposed method based on 2D  detection pipeline , meanwhile bridge the feature gap between detection and pose estimation. Our network has real-time processing capability, which runs 30â€¯fps on a GTX 1080Ti  GPU . For single object and multiple objects pose estimation on two benchmark datasets, our approach achieves competitive or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art RGB based pose estimation methods.",
