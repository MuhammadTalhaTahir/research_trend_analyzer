    "title": "Binocular stereo algorithm based on the disparity-gradient limit and using optimization theory",
    "abstract": "A new algorithm for stereo matching is presented, based on the idea of imposing a limit on disparity gradients allowed in the matched image. The matching problem will be expressed as one of maximizing a certain function, subject to constraints. Standard methods from optimization theory may then be used to find a solution.",
