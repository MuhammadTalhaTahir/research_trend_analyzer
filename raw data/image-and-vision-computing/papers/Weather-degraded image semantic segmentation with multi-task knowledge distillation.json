    "title": "Weather-degraded image semantic segmentation with multi-task knowledge distillation",
    "abstract": "The  semantic segmentation  of  degraded image  in adverse weather is of great importance for the  navigation system  of  autonomous driving . However, weather-degraded images increase the difficulty of semantic segmentation as well as decrease the accuracy. It is natural to integrate image enhancement into  degraded image  semantic segmentation to improve the accuracy, which is computation intensive and time consuming. To meet the challenge, we propose a fast degraded image semantic segmentation with Multi-Task  Knowledge Distillation  called MTKD. The proposed MTKD method encourages image enhancement and semantic segmentation networks to learn from each other to make full use of the correlation between two tasks. Additionally, we propose shift operator to realize a lightweight model design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MTKD outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only with better semantic  segmentation performance  but also with higher speed in weather-degraded images, which achieves 0.038 s in semantic segmentation for a 2048 Ã— 1024 image.",
