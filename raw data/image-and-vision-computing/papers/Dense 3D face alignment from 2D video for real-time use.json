    "title": "Dense 3D face alignment from 2D video for real-time use",
    "abstract": "To enable real-time, person-independent 3D registration from 2D video, we developed a 3D cascade regression approach in which facial landmarks remain invariant across pose over a range of approximately 60°. From a single 2D image of a person's face, a dense 3D shape is registered in real time for each frame. The algorithm utilizes a fast cascade regression framework trained on high-resolution 3D face-scans of posed and spontaneous emotion expression. The algorithm first estimates the location of a dense set of landmarks and their visibility, then reconstructs face shapes by fitting a part-based 3D model. Because no assumptions are required about illumination or surface properties, the method can be applied to a wide range of imaging conditions that include 2D video and uncalibrated multi-view video. The method has been validated in a  battery  of experiments that evaluate its precision of  3D reconstruction , extension to multi-view reconstruction, temporal integration for videos and 3D head-pose estimation. Experimental findings strongly support the validity of real-time, 3D registration and reconstruction from 2D video. The software is available online at  http://zface.org .",
