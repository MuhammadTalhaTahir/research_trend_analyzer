    "title": "An attention-based deep learning model for multiple pedestrian attributes recognition",
    "abstract": "The automatic characterization of pedestrians in surveillance footage is a tough challenge, particularly when the data is extremely diverse with cluttered backgrounds, and subjects are captured from varying distances, under multiple poses, with  partial occlusion . Having observed that the state-of-the-art performance is still unsatisfactory, this paper provides a novel solution to the problem, with two-fold contributions: 1) considering the  strong semantic  correlation between the different full-body attributes, we propose a multi-task deep model that uses an element-wise multiplication layer to extract more comprehensive feature representations. In practice, this layer serves as a filter to remove irrelevant background features, and is particularly important to handle complex, cluttered data; and 2) we introduce a weighted-sum term to the loss function that not only relativizes the contribution of each task but also is crucial for  performance improvement  in multiple-attribute inference settings. Our experiments were performed on two well-known datasets (RAP and PETA) and point for the superiority of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art.
