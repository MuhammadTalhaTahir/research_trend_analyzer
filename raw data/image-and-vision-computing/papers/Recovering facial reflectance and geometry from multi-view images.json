    "title": "Recovering facial reflectance and geometry from multi-view images",
    "abstract": "While the problem of estimating shapes and  diffuse reflectances  of human faces from images has been extensively studied, there is relatively less work done on recovering the specular  albedo . This paper presents a  lightweight  solution for inferring photorealistic facial reflectance and geometry. Our system processes video streams from two views of a subject, and outputs two  reflectance maps  for diffuse and specular albedos, as well as a vector map of surface normals. A model-based optimization approach is used, consisting of the three stages of multi-view  face model  fitting, facial reflectance inference and facial geometry refinement. Our approach is based on a novel formulation built upon the 3D  morphable model  (3DMM) for representing 3D textured faces in conjunction with the Blinn-Phong reflection model. It has the advantage of requiring only a simple setup with two video streams, and is able to exploit the interaction between the diffuse and  specular reflections  across multiple views as well as time frames. As a result, the method is able to reliably recover high-fidelity facial reflectance and geometry, which facilitates various applications such as generating photorealistic  facial images  under new viewpoints or  illumination conditions .",
