    "abstract": "Problem The eye fundus imaging is used for early diagnosis of most damaging concerns such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachments and vascular occlusions. However, the presence of noise, low contrast between background and vasculature during imaging, and vessel morphology lead to uncertain vessel segmentation. Aim This paper proposes a novel retinalblood vessel segmentation method for fundus imaging using a Difference of Gaussian (DoG) filter and an ensemble of three fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) models. Methods A Gaussian filter with standard deviation  σ 1  is applied on the preprocessed grayscale fundus image and is subtracted from a similarly applied Gaussian filter with standard deviation  σ 2  on the same image. The resultant image is then fed into each of the three fully convolutional neural networks as the input. The FCNN models' output is then passed through a voting classifier, and a final segmented vessel structure is obtained.The Difference of Gaussian filter played an essential part in removing the high frequency details (noise) and thus finely extracted the blood vessels from the retinal fundus with underlying artifacts. Results The total dataset consists of 3832 augmented images transformed from 479 fundus images. The result shows that the proposed method has performed extremely well by achieving an accuracy of 96.50%, 97.69%, and 95.78% on DRIVE, CHASE,and real-time clinical datasets respectively. Conclusion The FCNN ensemble model has demonstrated efficacy in precisely detecting retinal vessels and in the presence of various pathologies and vasculatures.",
