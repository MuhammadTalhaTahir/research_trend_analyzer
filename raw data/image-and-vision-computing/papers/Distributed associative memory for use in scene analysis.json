    "title": "Distributed associative memory for use in scene analysis",
    "abstract": "A distributed associative memory system which is ideal for scene analysis is described. Recall of associated patterns using incomplete originals is made possible by the use of a distributed storage mechanism and a novel recall procedure. The memory is shown to store associations between patterns more efficiently than a conventional file store. The paper describes the memory structure, the recall process and its storage abilities, as well as an example of its implementation in hardware.",
