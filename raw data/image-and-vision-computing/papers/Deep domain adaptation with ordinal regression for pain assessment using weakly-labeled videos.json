    "title": "Deep domain adaptation with ordinal regression for pain assessment using weakly-labeled videos",
    "abstract": "Estimation of pain intensity from facial expressions captured in videos has an immense potential for health care applications. Given the challenges related to subjective variations of facial expressions, and to operational capture conditions, the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models for recognizing facial expressions may decline.  Domain adaptation  (DA) has been widely explored to alleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occur between video data captured across various source (laboratory) and target (operational) domains. Moreover, given the laborious task of collecting and annotating videos, and the subjective bias due to ambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning (WSL) is gaining attention in such applications. State-of-the-art WSL models are typically formulated as  regression problems , and do not leverage the ordinal relationship among pain intensity levels, nor the temporal coherence of multiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new DL model for weakly-supervised DA with ordinal regression (WSDA-OR) that can be adapted using target domain videos with coarse labels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR model enforces ordinal relationships among the intensity levels assigned to target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level labels (instead of a single frame). In particular, it learns discriminant and domain-invariant feature representations by integrating multiple  instance learning  with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels are used to efficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from the target domain. The proposed approach was validated using the RECOLA video dataset as fully-labeled  source domain data , and UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain video dataset as weakly-labeled  target domain data . We have also validated WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue (private) datasets for sequence level estimation. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach can significantly improve performance over the state-of-the-art models, allowing to achieve a greater pain localization accuracy.
