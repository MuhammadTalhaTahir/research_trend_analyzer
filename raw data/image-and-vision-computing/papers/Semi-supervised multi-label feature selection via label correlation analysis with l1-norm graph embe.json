    "title": "Semi-supervised multi-label feature selection via label correlation analysis with l1-norm graph embedding",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-label feature  selection algorithm  and apply it to three different applications: natural scene classification, web page annotation, and yeast gene functional classification. Compared with the previous works, there are two advantages of our algorithm: (1) Manifold learning which leverages the underlying geometric structure of the  training data  is imposed to utilize both labeled and  unlabeled data . Besides, the underlying manifold structure is guaranteed to be clear by using the  l 1 -norm  regularization . (2) Shared subspace learning which has shown its efficiency in multi-label learning scenarios, is also considered in our  feature learning  algorithm. The proposed objective function involves  l 2,1 -norm and  l 1 -norm, making it non-smooth and difficult to solve. We also design an efficient  iterative algorithm  to optimize it. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm compared with sate-of-the-art algorithms on different tasks.",
