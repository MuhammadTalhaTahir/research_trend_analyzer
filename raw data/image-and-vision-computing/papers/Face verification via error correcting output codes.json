    "title": "Face verification via error correcting output codes",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to  face verification  based on the Error Correcting Output Coding (ECOC)  classifier design  concept. In the training phase, the client set is repeatedly divided into two ECOC specified sub-sets (super-classes) to train a set of  binary classifiers . The output of the classifiers defines the ECOC  feature space , in which it is easier to separate transformed patterns representing clients and impostors. As a matching score in this space, we propose the average first order  Minkowski distance  between the probe and gallery images. The proposed method exhibits superior verification performance on the well known XM2VTS data set as compared with previously reported results.",
