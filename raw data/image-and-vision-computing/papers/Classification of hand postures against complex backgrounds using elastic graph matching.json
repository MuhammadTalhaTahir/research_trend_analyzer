    "title": "Classification of hand postures against complex backgrounds using elastic graph matching",
    "abstract": "A system for person-independent classification of hand postures against complex backgrounds in video images is presented. The system employs elastic  graph matching , which has already been successfully applied for object and  face recognition . We use the bunch graph technique to model variance in hand posture appearance between different subjects and variance in backgrounds. Our system does not need a separate segmentation stage but closely integrates finding the object boundaries with posture classification.",
