    "title": "Fast spatial–temporal stereo matching for 3D face reconstruction under speckle pattern projection",
    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) face reconstruction can be tackled in either measurement-based means or model-based means. The former requires special hardwares or devices, such as structured light setups. This paper addresses 3D face reconstruction by measurement-based means, more specifically a special kind of structured light called space–time speckle projection. Under such a setup, we propose a novel and efficient spatial–temporal stereo scheme towards fast and accurate 3D face recovery. To improve the overall computational efficiency, our scheme consists of a series of  optimization strategies  including face-cropping-based  stereo matching , coarse-to-fine  stereo matching  strategy applied to face areas, and spatial–temporal integral image (STII) for accelerating the matching cost computation. Based on the results, the proposed scheme is able to reconstruct a 3D face in hundreds of milliseconds on a normal PC, and its performance is validated both qualitatively and quantitatively.",
