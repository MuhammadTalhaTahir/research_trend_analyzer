    "title": "Measures of correspondence between binary patterns",
    "abstract": "Some measures for the quantitative description of correspondence relations between binary patterns are proposed and analysed. Some of these are based upon measures of area for finite grid point sets, and others on distance mappings indicating the minimum distance of a grid point from a given grid point set. For the second type of measure, two algorithms for computing the degree of correspondence are described. Some examples of their application to real binary images, and the processing time required, are given.",
