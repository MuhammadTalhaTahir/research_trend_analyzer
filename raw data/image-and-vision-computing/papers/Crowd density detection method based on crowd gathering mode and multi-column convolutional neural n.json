    "title": "Crowd density detection method based on crowd gathering mode and multi-column convolutional neural network",
    "abstract": "Crowds and stampedes often occur in crowd gathering places, resulting in a large number of casualties and causing great negative social impacts. Traditional research on the dynamic assessment of crowd gathering safety mainly relies on real-time video monitoring, but lacks reliable methods for processing a large amount of  video data  from different sources, different perspectives and different  granularities . Based on Edward Hall's  personal space  theory, this article considers crowd psychology and other factors, and establishes static basic model of crowd gathering patterns. In order to fuse real-time multi-granularity  surveillance videos  with different perspectives, a multi-column  convolutional neural network  (M-CNN) was used to extract the local density characteristics of the crowd in a low-altitude perspective, thereby establishing a holographic model of the  temporal and spatial evolution  of the crowd situation, and a new crowd gathering safety assessment method. This method was actually applied to the safety assessment of crowd gathering in Suzhou landmark-Urban Living Fountain Square, and achieved good results, providing theoretical support for the safety management of crowd gathering places.",
