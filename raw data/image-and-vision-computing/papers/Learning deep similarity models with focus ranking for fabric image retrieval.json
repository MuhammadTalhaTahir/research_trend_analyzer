    "title": "Learning deep similarity models with focus ranking for fabric image retrieval",
    "abstract": "Fabric  image retrieval  is beneficial to many applications including clothing searching, online shopping and cloth modeling. Learning pairwise image similarity is of great importance to an image retrieval task. With the  resurgence  of  Convolutional Neural Networks  (CNNs), recent works have achieved significant progresses via  deep representation learning  with metric embedding, which drives similar examples close to each other in a  feature space , and dissimilar ones apart from each other. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method termed  focus ranking  that can be easily unified into a CNN for jointly learning image representations and metrics in the context of fine-grained fabric image retrieval. Focus ranking aims to rank similar examples higher than all dissimilar ones by penalizing ranking disorders via the minimization of the overall cost attributed to similar samples being ranked below dissimilar ones. At the training stage,  training samples  are organized into focus ranking units for efficient optimization. We build a large-scale fabric image retrieval dataset (FIRD) with about 25,000 images of 4300 fabrics, and test the proposed model on the FIRD dataset. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed model over existing metric embedding models.",
