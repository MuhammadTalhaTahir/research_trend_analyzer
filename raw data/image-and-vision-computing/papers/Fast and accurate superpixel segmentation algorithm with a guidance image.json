    "title": "Fast and accurate superpixel segmentation algorithm with a guidance image",
    "abstract": "Superpixels  are generated by automatically grouping image pixels into lots and lots of compact segments. In  computer vision , it is widely used as an effective way to reduce the number of image primitives for subsequent tasks and for recognizing objectsâ€™ contours due to its excellent boundary adhesion. The primary concerns of a superpixel generation algorithm are its efficiency and accuracy. In this document, we aim to propose a fast and precise superpixel  segmentation algorithm  with a guidance image. Specifically, we introduce a rolling filter that can remove details while well preserving the boundaries to obtain the guidance image. In the meantime, we introduce a robust edge confidence operator to accurately detect image boundaries. From this, we define a distance measurement with adaptive parameters for each image. In this way, we can adapt and accurately group pixels into regions according to the new distance measurement. Furthermore, we adopt a noniterative framework to generate superpixels in real time by processing all pixels once. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on two sets of  reference data  while operating in real time.",
