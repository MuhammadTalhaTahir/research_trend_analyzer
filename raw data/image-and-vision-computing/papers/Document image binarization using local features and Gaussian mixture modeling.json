    "title": "Document image binarization using local features and Gaussian mixture modeling",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the  document image   binarization  problem with a three-stage procedure. First, possible stains and general document  background information  are removed from the image through a background removal stage. The remaining misclassified background and character pixels are then separated using a Local Co-occurrence Mapping,  local contrast  and a two-state  Gaussian Mixture Model . Finally, some isolated misclassified components are removed by a morphology operator. The proposed scheme offers robust and fast performance, especially for both handwritten and printed documents, which compares favorably with other binarization methods.",
