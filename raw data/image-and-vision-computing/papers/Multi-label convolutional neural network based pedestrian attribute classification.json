    "title": "Multi-label convolutional neural network based pedestrian attributeÂ classification",
    "abstract": "Recently, pedestrian attributes like gender, age, clothing etc., have been used as soft  biometric traits  for recognizing people. Unlike existing methods that assume the independence of attributes during their prediction, we propose a multi-label  convolutional neural network  (MLCNN) to predict multiple attributes together in a unified framework. Firstly, a pedestrian image is roughly divided into multiple overlapping body parts, which are simultaneously integrated in the multi-label  convolutional neural network . Secondly, these parts are filtered independently and aggregated in the cost layer. The  cost function  is a combination of multiple  binary attribute  classification cost functions. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the  SVM  based method on the PETA database.",
