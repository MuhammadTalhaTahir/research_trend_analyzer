    "title": "Design of multi-scale receptive field convolutional neural network for surface inspection of hot rolled steels",
    "abstract": "Due to the large intra-class variations and unbalanced training samples, the accuracy of existing algorithms used in  defect classification  of hot rolled steels is unsatisfactory. In this paper, a new  hierarchical learning  framework is proposed based on  convolutional neural networks  to classify hot rolled defects. Multi-scale receptive field is introduced in the new framework to extract multi-scale features, which can better represent defects than the feature maps produced by a single  convolutional layer . A group of  AutoEncoders  are trained to reduce the dimension of the extracted multi-scale features which improve the generalization ability under insufficient training samples. Besides, to mitigate the deviation caused by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with images of different context, we add a penalty term in the loss function, which is to reconstruct the input image from the feature maps produced by the pre-trained model, to help network encode more effective and structured information. The experiments with samples captured from two hot rolled production lines showed that the proposed framework achieved a classification rate of 97.2% and 97% respectively, which are much higher than the conventional methods.",
