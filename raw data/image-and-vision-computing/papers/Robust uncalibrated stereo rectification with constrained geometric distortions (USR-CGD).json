    "title": "Robust uncalibrated stereo rectification with constrained geometric distortions (USR-CGD)",
    "abstract": "A novel algorithm for uncalibrated stereo image-pair  rectification  under the constraint of  geometric distortion , called USR-CGD, is presented in this work. Although it is straightforward to define a rectifying transformation (or homography) given the epipolar geometry, many existing algorithms have unwanted geometric distortions as a side effect. To obtain rectified images with reduced geometric distortions while maintaining a small  rectification  error, we parameterize the  homography  by considering the influence of various kinds of geometric distortions. Next, we define several geometric measures and incorporate them into a new  cost function  as  regularization  terms for parameter optimization. Finally, we propose a constrained adaptive optimization scheme to allow a balanced performance between the rectification error and the geometric error. Extensive experimental results are provided to demonstrate the superb performance of the proposed USR-CGD method, which outperforms existing algorithms by a significant margin.",
