    "title": "L2,1-based regression and prediction accumulation across views for robust facial landmark detection",
    "abstract": "We propose a new methodology for facial landmark detection. Similar to other state-of-the-art methods, we rely on the use of cascaded regression to perform inference, and we use a feature representation that results from concatenating 66 HOG descriptors, one per landmark. However, we propose a novel  regression method  that substitutes the commonly used  Least Squares   regressor . This new method makes use of the  L 2,1  norm, and it is designed to increase the robustness of the  regressor  to poor initialisations (e.g., due to large out of plane head poses) or  partial occlusions . Furthermore, we propose to use multiple initialisations, consisting of both spatial translation and 4 head poses corresponding to different pan rotations. These estimates are aggregated into a single prediction in a robust manner. Both strategies are designed to improve the  convergence behaviour  of the algorithm, so that it can cope with the challenges of in-the-wild data. We further detail some important experimental details, and show extensive performance comparisons highlighting the  performance improvement  attained by the method proposed here.",
