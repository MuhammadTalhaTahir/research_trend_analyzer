    "title": "A fast vector quantization encoding algorithm based on projection pyramid with Hadamard transformation",
    "abstract": "Vector quantization  (VQ) for  image compression  requires expensive time to find the closest codevector in the encoding process. In this paper, a fast search algorithm is proposed for projection pyramid vector quantization using a lighter modified distortion with  Hadamard transform  of the vector. The algorithm uses projection pyramids of the vectors and codevectors after applying Hadamard transform and one elimination criterion based on deviation  characteristic values  in the Hadamard transform domain to eliminate unlikely codevectors. Experimental results are presented on image block data. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with the same quality of the image as the full search algorithm.",
