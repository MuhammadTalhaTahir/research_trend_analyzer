    "title": "Enhancing effective depth-of-field by image fusion using mathematical morphology",
    "abstract": "Reduced depth-of-field (DOF) poses a problem in the light  optical imaging  system, since the objects present outside this zone appear blurry in the recorded image. The effective DOF of the sensor may be enhanced considerably without compromising the quality of the image by fusing images captured with different focused regions. This paper presents an  image fusion technique  suitable for combining multifocus images of a scene. The method employs  morphological filters  to select sharply focused regions from various images and then combines them together to reconstruct the image in which all the regions are properly focused. A  performance measure  based on image gradients is used to compare the results obtained by the proposed method with those obtained by other image fusion techniques.",
