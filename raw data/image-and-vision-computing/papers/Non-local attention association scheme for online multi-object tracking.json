    "title": "Non-local attention association scheme for online multi-object tracking",
    "abstract": "Online multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental problem in video analysis and  multimedia applications . The major challenge in the popular tracking-by-detection framework is knowing how to associate candidate detections results with existing tracklets. In this, we propose a non-local attention association approach and apply it to a unified online MOT framework that integrates the merits of single object tracking and  data association  methods. Specifically, we use non-local attention association networks (NAAN) to incorporate both spatial and temporal characteristics to associate new detections. The non-local  attention mechanism  generates global attention maps across space and time, enabling the network to focus on the whole tracklet information, as opposed to the local attention mechanism to overcome the problems of noisy detections, occlusion, and frequent interactions between targets. Experimental results on MOT benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against various online trackers on the basis of identity-preserving metrics.",
