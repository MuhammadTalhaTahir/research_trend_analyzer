    "title": "Introducing the structural bases of typicality effects in deep learning",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we hypothesize that the effects of the degree of typicality in natural  semantic categories  can be generated based on the structure of artificial categories learned with  deep learning models . Motivated by the human approach to representing natural semantic categories and based on the  Prototype Theory  foundations, we propose a novel Computational  Prototype Model  (CPM) to represent the internal structure of semantic categories. Unlike other prototype  learning approaches , our mathematical framework proposes a first approach to provide  deep neural networks  with the ability to model abstract  semantic concepts  such as category central semantic meaning, typicality degree of an object's image, and  family resemblance  relationship. We proposed several methodologies based on the typicality's concept to evaluate our CPM-model in image  semantic processing  tasks such as  image classification , a global  semantic description , and  transfer learning . Our experiments on different image datasets, such as ImageNet and Coco, showed that our approach might be an admissible proposition in the effort to endow machines with greater power of abstraction for the  semantic representation  of objects' categories.",
