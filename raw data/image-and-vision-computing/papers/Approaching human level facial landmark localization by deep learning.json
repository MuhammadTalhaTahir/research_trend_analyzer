    "title": "Approaching human level facial landmark localization by deep learning",
    "abstract": "In this paper we present our solution to the 300 Faces in the Wild Facial Landmark Localization Challenge. We demonstrate how to achieve very competitive  localization performance  with a simple  deep learning  based system. Human study is conducted to show that the accuracy of our system has been very close to  human performance . We discuss how this finding would affect our future direction to improve our system.",
