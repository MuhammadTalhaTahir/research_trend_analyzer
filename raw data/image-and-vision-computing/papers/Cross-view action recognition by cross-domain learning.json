    "title": "Cross-view action recognition by cross-domain learning",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel cross-view  human action recognition  method by discovering and sharing  common knowledge  among different video sets captured in multiple viewpoints. We treat a specific view as target domain and the others as source domains and consequently formulate the cross-view action recognition into the cross-domain learning framework. First, the classic bag-of-visual word framework is implemented for visual feature extraction in individual viewpoints. Then, we add two  transformation matrices  in order to transform original action feature from different views into one common  feature space , and also combine the original feature and the transformation feature to proposed the new feature  mapping function  for target and  auxiliary  domains respectively. Finally, we proposed a new method to learn the two  transformation matrices  in model training step based on the standard SVM solver and generate the final classifier for each human action. Extensive experiments are implemented on IXMAS, and TJU. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently outperform the state-of-the-arts.",
