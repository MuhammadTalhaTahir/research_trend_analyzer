    "title": "Adaptive and fast image superpixel segmentation approach",
    "abstract": "Superpixel  is one of the most popular image over-segmentations with broad applications in the  computer vision  field to reduce their computations by replacing pixels as primitives. The main concerns of one superpixel generation algorithm are its accuracy and efficiency. One of the most important things in superpixel accuracy is to fit the image boundaries tightly with a few pixels as possible (namely minimal contour density, which is measured by the percent of superpixel contour pixels in the whole image). In this paper, we propose a new fast algorithm based on the  clustering method  to produce superpixels accurately with low contour density. First, we adopt the linear path from a pixel to one superpixel seed to define a regular term and propose a new distance measurement between them. In addition, we introduce the gradient and  Local Binary Pattern  (LBP) features and propose formulas of parameters in the proposed method adaptively. In this way, we can use the new distance measurement to group pixels as initial regions adaptively and produce the final superpixels by merging those small ones. Finally, we test the new algorithm on two public datasets and compare it with the state-of-the-art. Our method can generate superpixels with lower contour density while being competitive in accuracy and  computational time .",
