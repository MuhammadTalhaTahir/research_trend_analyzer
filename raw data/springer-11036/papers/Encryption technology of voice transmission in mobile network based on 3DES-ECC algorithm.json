    "title": "Encryption technology of voice transmission in mobile network based on 3DES-ECC algorithm",
    "abstract": "The traditional design of voice collector has poor anti attack ability, which makes the encryption effect of voice transmission poor. Therefore, taking the mobile network voice collector as the research object, 3des-ecc algorithm is applied to the information transmission encryption of the mobile network voice collector.An improved speech signal collector is designed, which combines 3DES and ECC algorithm to realize the encryption of speech transmission information. An improved voice signal collector is designed, which combines 3DES and ECC algorithm to realize the encryption of voice transmission information. In the process of encryption, 168-bit random key is generated first, and it is grouped according to 56 bits as 3DES key, and then the plaintext is encrypted by the key to generate ciphertext; the random key is encrypted by ECC public key of the receiver. The experimental results show that the encryption time of this method is less than 1&nbsp;s, the data integrity is 93%, and the data loss rate is only 0.33%. It has better anti attack ability, fast encryption speed and good encryption effect.",
