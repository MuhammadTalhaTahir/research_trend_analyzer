    "title": "Replication Requirements in Mobile Environments",
    "abstract": "Replication is extremely important in mobile environments because nomadic users require local copies of important data. However, today's replication systems are not “mobile-ready”. Instead of improving the mobile user's environment, the replication system actually hinders mobility and complicates mobile operation. Designed for stationary environments, the replication services do not and cannot provide mobile users with the capabilities they require. Replication in mobile environments requires fundamentally different solutions than those previously proposed, because nomadicity presents a fundamentally new and different computing paradigm. Here we outline the requirements that mobility places on the replication service, and briefly describe ROAM, a system designed to meet those requirements.",
