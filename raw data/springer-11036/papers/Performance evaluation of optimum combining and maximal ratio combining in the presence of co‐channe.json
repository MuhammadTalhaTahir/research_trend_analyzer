    "abstract": "Antenna diversity is an important technique to combat fading and reduce co‐channel interference (CCI). In this paper, we present an analytical approach to derive bit error rate (BER) for Optimum Combining (OC) and Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) in the presence of CCI. The paper has two parts. In the first part, the analysis of BER for OC with two co‐channel interferers and MRC with an arbitrary number of interferers is presented for M‐array antenna systems under the assumption that the channels of users are independent of each other. In the second part, the analysis of BER for OC and MRC in the presence of one dominant co‐channel interferer is presented for dual antenna systems by assuming that the channels of the desired user or co‐channel interferer are correlated. For DPSK signal, an exact BER expression is derived. The work presented here also yields an upper bound for BPSK or QAM signal based on the results of Foschini and Salz (1983).",
