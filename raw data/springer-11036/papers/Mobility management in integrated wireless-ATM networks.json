    "title": "Mobility management in integrated wireless-ATM networks",
    "abstract": "There is an emerging interest in integrating mobile wireless communication with Broadband ISDN based on the ATM technology. Many issues arise when such integration is attempted. This paper addresses the problem of mobility management, i.e., that of tracking the current ATM addresses of mobile terminals and sustaining active ATM connections as mobiles move. The paper presents some architectural options for integrating wireless access to ATM networks and highlights an architecture based oninterworking devices to provide transparent mobility support in existing ATM networks. Location management and handoff solutions for this architecture are then presented. Also, how procedures for multiprotocol transport over ATM networks may be adopted to perform location management is described.",
