    "title": "Research on Standardized Feature Positioning Technology of Motion Amplitude Based on Intelligent Vision",
    "abstract": "Traditional motion amplitude normalization technology cannot get the whole process of motion amplitude in the time and space domain, and there is a big error in motion image contour extraction, which leads to low accuracy and long time. Therefore, a motion amplitude normalized feature localization technique based on intelligent vision is proposed. The contour of the moving image is extracted by the method of color information segmentation. The motion process in time and space is simulated by intelligent vision, and the feature data are captured by the parameters of the human motion sensor. According to the horizontal rotation record and geomagnetic flux of the sensor, the feature data is processed by normalization, and the moving image features are selected by normalization. The amplitude function is established to optimize the foreground region feature marker of the motion image, and the motion amplitude standard feature location is realized. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more accurate and less time-consuming than the traditional method.",
