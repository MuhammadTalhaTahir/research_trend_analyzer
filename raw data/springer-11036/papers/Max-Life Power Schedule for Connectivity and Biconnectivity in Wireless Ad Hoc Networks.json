    "title": "Max-Life Power Schedule for Connectivity and Biconnectivity in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks",
    "abstract": "Given the initial energy supplies and the maximal transmission power of the individual nodes in a wireless ad hoc network, a power schedule of duration t for a specified topological property $$\\mathcal{P}$$ is a scheduling of the transmission powers of the individual nodes over the period [0, t] such that (1) the total amount of energy consumed by each node during the period [0, t] does not exceed its initial energy supply, (2) the transmission power of each node at any moment in the period [0, t] does not exceed its maximal transmission power, and (3) the produced network topology at any moment in the period [0, t] satisfies the property $$\\mathcal{P}$$ . The problem Max-Life Power Schedule for $$\\mathcal{P}$$ seeks a power schedule of the maximal duration for $$\\mathcal{P}$$ . Let g be the golden ratio $$(1+\\sqrt{5}) /2$$ , and Îµ be an arbitrarily positive constant less than one. In this paper, we present a $$9g/\\left(1-\\varepsilon\\right)^{2}$$ -approximation algorithm for Max-Life Power Schedule for Connectivity, a $$36g/\\!\\left(1-\\varepsilon\\right)^{2}$$ -approximation algorithm for Max-Life Power Schedule for 2-Node-Connectivity, and a $$36g/\\!\\left(1-\\varepsilon\\right)^{2}$$ -approximation algorithm for Max-Life Power Schedule for 2-Edge-Connectivity.",
