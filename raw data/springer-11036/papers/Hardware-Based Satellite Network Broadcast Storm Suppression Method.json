    "title": "Hardware-Based Satellite Network Broadcast Storm Suppression Method",
    "abstract": "Satellite networks provide high-bandwidth, wide-coverage network services that complement ground networks.However, multitudinous loop links in satellite networks can lead to broadcast storms, where broadcast packets continuously propagate along the loops in the network, ultimately resulting in network paralysis. Existing solutions, such as Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, often result in low bandwidth utilization and higher forwarding latency. This paper introduces a novel hardware-based approach to mitigate these challenges by selectively suppressing redundant broadcasts. Unlike traditional methods, our approach utilizes a RAM-based lookup table to record the characteristics and timestamps of broadcast packets, then determines whether the packets should be discarded or forwarded based on these records.In the experiment, the proposed approach achieves a frequency of 251.8 MHz and an on-chip power of 0.106W on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip.",
