    "title": "A Routing Protocol Combining Link State and Distance Vector for GEO-GEO Satellite Backbone Network",
    "abstract": "For the demand of GEO-GEO satellite backbone networking construction based on inter-satellite link and satellite-to-ground link, this study focuses on satellite routing protocol solution. At the beginning, the deficiency of terrestrial network routing protocol based on distance vector (for example: RIP) and link state (for example: OSPF) applied directly to GEO-GEO satellite backbone network is analyzed. It proves to have problems such as excessive link cost and slow routing convergence rate. Therefore a novel satellite routing protocol for GEO-GEO satellite backbone network is proposed, which is called SDSRP (the link State and Distance vector combined Satellite Routing Protocol). Then the cost of satellite-to-ground link and route convergence are analyzed and simulated. The simulation results indicate that the proposed protocol can greatly reduce the satellite-to-ground link cost, and can obviously improve the routing convergence rate, which meet the requirements of GEO-GEO satellite backbone network application scenarios.",
