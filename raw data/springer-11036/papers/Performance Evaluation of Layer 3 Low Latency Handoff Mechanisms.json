    "title": "Performance Evaluation of Layer 3 Low Latency Handoff Mechanisms",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the performance of two Layer 3 low latency handoff mechanisms proposed by the IETF, namely Pre- and Post-Registration. These protocols use Layer 2 triggers to reduce the built-in delay components of Mobile IP. We propose a simple analytical model that allows assessing the packet loss and the delay characteristics of these mechanisms. We describe several handoff implementations over a wireless access based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and analyze several implementation issues. Finally we study the scalability of the protocols using an OPNET simulation.",
