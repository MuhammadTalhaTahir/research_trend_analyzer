    "title": "Few-Shot Malware Classification via Attention-Based Transductive Learning Network",
    "abstract": "Malware has now grown into one of the most important threats on the Internet. To meet this challenge, researchers regard malware classification as an effective method in malware analysis, which can classify the malicious samples with similar features into the same family. Although machine learning based malware classification models have great performance, they rely heavily on large-scale labeled datasets. In the real world, many malware families only have a small number of samples, which makes the traditional data-driven models perform poor results. In this paper, we propose an attention-based transductive learning network to solve the problem. In order to extract features, our approach first converts malware binaries into gray-scale images, and encodes them into feature maps using an embedding function. Then, we build a Gaussian similarity graph based on attention mechanism to transfer information from labeled instances to unknown instances. Through the end-to-end training, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a malware dataset containing 11,236 samples with 30 different malware families. Comparing with state-of-the-art approaches, the experimental results show that our approach achieves a better performance.",
