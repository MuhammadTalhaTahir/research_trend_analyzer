    "title": "QUORUMâ€”Quality of Service in Wireless Mesh Networks",
    "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) can provide seamless broadband connectivity to network users with low setup and maintenance costs. To support next-generation applications with real-time requirements, however, these networks must provide improved quality of service guarantees. Current mesh protocols use techniques that fail to accurately predict the performance of end-to-end paths, and do not optimize performance based on knowledge of mesh network structures. In this paper, we propose QUORUM, a routing protocol optimized for WMNs that provides accurate QoS properties by correctly predicting delay and loss characteristics of data traffic. QUORUM integrates a novel end-to-end packet delay estimation mechanism with stability-aware routing policies, allowing it to more accurately follow QoS requirements while minimizing misbehavior of selfish nodes.",
