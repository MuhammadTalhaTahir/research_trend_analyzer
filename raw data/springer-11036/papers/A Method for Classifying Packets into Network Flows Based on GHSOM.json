    "title": "A Method for Classifying Packets into Network Flows Based on GHSOM",
    "abstract": "Recently, various applications and services are used in the Internet. Load balancing the increasing network traffic in real time can improve the network quality. The flow control technologies become much more important than before. Our research proposes an intelligent network flow identifying method, which is based on the neural network algorithm, GHSOM. In this paper, we suggest to utilize the structural classification of GHSOM for training the properties of packets, such as timestamp, source and destination. Based on our proposed normalization, IP network flows can be formed autonomously during the learning process. The combination use of the new normalization with the GHSOM can divide a flow to several sub-IP flows. This paper indicates that a flow shall consist of several sub-IP flows, and sub-IP flow shall consist of several IP packets. The experiments show that IP packets can be divided to flow and sub-IP flow classes properly. Furthermore, those repeated jumbo sub-IP flows can be used to discover communicating errors or abnormal attacks.",
