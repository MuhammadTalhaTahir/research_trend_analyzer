    "title": "The Impact of Cooperative Nodes on the Performance of Vehicular Delay-Tolerant Networks",
    "abstract": "Vehicular communications refer to a wide range of networks proposed for environments characterized by sparse connectivity, frequent network partitioning, intermittent connectivity, long propagation delays, asymmetric data rates, and high error rates. These environments may also be characterized by a potential non-available end-to-end path. To overcome these issues and improve the overall network performance, cooperation between network nodes must be severely considered. Nodes may cooperate by sharing their storage capacity, bandwidth, or even energy resources. However, nodes may be unwilling to cooperate due to a selfish behavior or to an intent to protect the integrity of their own resources. This selfish behavior significantly affects the functionality and performance of the network. This paper overviews the most recent advances related with cooperation on vehicular networks. It also studies the impact of different cooperation levels in the performance of Vehicular Delay-Tolerant Networks (VDTNs). It was shown that scenarios with a higher number of cooperative nodes present the best results in terms of bundle delivery delay.",
