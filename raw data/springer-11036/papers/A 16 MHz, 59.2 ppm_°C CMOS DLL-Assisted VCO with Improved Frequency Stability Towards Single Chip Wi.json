    "title": "A 16 MHz, 59.2 ppm/°C CMOS DLL-Assisted VCO with Improved Frequency Stability Towards Single Chip Wireless IOT",
    "abstract": "A 16&nbsp;MHz, highly stable voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is reported in this paper. The proposed VCO consists of three cross-coupled RC stages, and is fully compatible with standard CMOS process. A positively biased PN junction with negative temperature coefficient is incorporated in the design to compensate frequency drift. In addition, a delay locked loop (DLL) directly following the VCO is utilized to further improve the output stability caused by temperature variations. The designed circuit was implemented using CMOS 0.18&nbsp;μm technology, and was validated through experiments. Measurement results show that the DLL-assisted VCO output variation across the 25~120&nbsp;°C temperature range is less than 0.56&nbsp;%, corresponding to 59.2&nbsp;ppm/°C. It also shows that the output standard deviation of the DLL-assisted VCO is only 6.816 KHz, ~ 16.6&nbsp;% better compared with the same VCO without DLL’s assistance.",
