    "title": "A scalable wireless virtual LAN",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a Wireless Virtual Local Area Network (WVLAN) to support mobility in IP‐over‐ATM local area networks. Mobility is handled by a joint ATM‐layer handoff for connection rerouting and MAC‐layer handoff for location tracking, such that the effects of mobility are localized and transparent to the higher‐layer protocols. Different functions, such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), mobile location, and ATM connection admission are combined to reduce protocol overhead and front‐end delay for connectionless packet transmission in connection‐oriented ATM networks. The proposed WVLAN, through the use of ATM technology, provides a scalable wireless virtual LAN solution for IP mobile hosts.",
