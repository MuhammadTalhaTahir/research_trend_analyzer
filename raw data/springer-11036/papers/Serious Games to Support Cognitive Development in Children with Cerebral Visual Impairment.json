    "title": "Serious Games to Support Cognitive Development in Children with Cerebral Visual Impairment",
    "abstract": "Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI) is a disability that entails a visual deficit, due to a brain damage. Children affected by this disability are not able to see an object if it is not moving. In this paper, we present a study on the use of serious games in the assessment and rehabilitation of children with CVI. Our serious games help them keeping focused on the exercise by using touch interface, game paradigm and cartoon characters. The paper reports lesson learned from data collected in a user study to highlight the high potential of using these games also in the rehabilitation process. For this reason, we develop the games also in the mobile platforms to allow children to train their skills at home, i.e., more intensively and in a familiar environment.",
