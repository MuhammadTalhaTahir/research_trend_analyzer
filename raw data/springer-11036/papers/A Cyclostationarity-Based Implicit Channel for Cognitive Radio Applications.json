    "title": "A Cyclostationarity-Based Implicit Channel for Cognitive Radio Applications",
    "abstract": "Cognitive Radio (CR) technology is believed to be a favorable complement to current and future wireless communication systems, due to its distinctive capability in promoting spectrum efficiency. However, as the number of CR applications increases, coexistence has become a vital issue for radio systems in CR networks. In this paper, a Cyclostationarity-based Implicit Channel (CIC) is proposed to assist conflict-avoidance coexistence for radio systems in the CR networks with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). First, an asymptotic maximum likelihood demodulation scheme is derived analytically based on a bijective-mapping based modulation. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed CIC is investigated via numerical simulations. It is demonstrated that the CIC can work effectively as an information sharing platform. Moreover, the CIC can work as an independent add-on module to the data bearing OFDM schemes, with minimum impact on the existing systems. Therefore, it is a highly attractive solution for delivering coexistence information in CR networks.",
