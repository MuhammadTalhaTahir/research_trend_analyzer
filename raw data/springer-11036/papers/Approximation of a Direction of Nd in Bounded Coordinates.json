    "title": "Approximation of a Direction of Nd in Bounded Coordinates",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the following problem: a direction in R d is given by a vector with large integral coordinates and we have to find a vector with bounded integral coordinates which realizes a good approximation of this direction. We present a short algorithm that efficiently computes an optimal approximation with respect to the distance to the direction. We then compare experimental results with those of a straightforward rounding algorithm with respect to the distance to the direction and to the angle with it.",
