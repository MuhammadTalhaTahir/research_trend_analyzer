    "title": "A Lightweight Intelligent Manufacturing System Based on Cloud Computing for Plate Production",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a flexible lightweight plate intelligent manufacturing system (LPIMS) based on cloud computing and assembly manufacturing process is proposed for industry 4.0. The system allows optimizing automated production manufacturing process to save raw materials and improve the production efficiency. A multi-layered LPIMS framework is introduced for assisting the system and the corresponding function module is analyzed. Moreover, the critical concept of optimal state is proposed in the optimal intelligent manufacturing to realize precise process control. Based on the optimal control requirements, we present an intelligent insulating glass production line based on LPIMS, we analyze key optimization problems and corresponding coupled relationships existed in the production line, and we develop an integrated method to achieve the optimal control effect to minimize the total trim loss and enhance productivity and mobility.",
