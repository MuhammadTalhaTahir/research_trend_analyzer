    "title": "Comparison of Multimedia Delivery Scenarios Using Parallel Wireless Links and Path Diversity",
    "abstract": "Several scenarios to deliver multimedia streams in wireless multi-hop networks, as in the wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) environment, are considered and examined. Those scenarios considered in this paper are not new but they are examined in a new environment where the system is benefited from path diversity and cooperative diversity. By simulation, we examine those scenarios in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based wireless network. The simulation results demonstrate how much path diversity and cooperative diversity improve the performance in average sense. We also discuss open research issues on resource utilization in emerging wireless networks.",
