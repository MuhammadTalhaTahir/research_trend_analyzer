    "abstract": "This paper presents a spatially distributed and dynamic billing, pricing and allocation mechanism for which a user terminal requires Cognitive Radio abilities. That is, the Cognitive Radio abilities will be applied to the economical environment. The radio resource goods are allocated to the users by a multi-unit sealed-bid auction. Intelligent entities like the bidding strategy have to represent operator’s and users’ behavior and to make decisions for them in order to fulfill the preferences and QoS. The main functionalities, used to execute the dynamic auction sequence and located in the MAC are described, assuming the entities possess Cognitive Radio abilities.",
