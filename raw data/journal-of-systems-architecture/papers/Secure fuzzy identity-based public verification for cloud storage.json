    "title": "Secure fuzzy identity-based public verification for cloud storage",
    "abstract": "The rapid development of  cloud storage services  brings many security challenges. Data integrity, as the top priority of these security challenges, has always been a research hotspot. Data  integrity verification  protocols enable verifiers to verify remote data integrity by employing sample auditing and homomorphic  authenticators  without downloading  outsourced data . The existing fuzzy identity-based public verification schemes have multiple  security vulnerabilities , which are easily exploited by malicious participants to attack the security of the scheme, posing a great threat to the practical application of the scheme. In the paper, we give a secure fuzzy identity-based public verification scheme that simultaneously supports fuzzy identity-based public verification and resists the attacks by various involved parties. In addition, the security and usability of the scheme are verified by detailed security proofs and implementations. Compared with existing fuzzy identity-based public verification schemes, our scheme fixes the security vulnerabilities of fuzzy identity-based public verification schemes and provides stronger security.",
