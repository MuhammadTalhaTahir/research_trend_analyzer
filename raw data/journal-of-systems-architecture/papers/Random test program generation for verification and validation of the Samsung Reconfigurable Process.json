    "title": "Random test program generation for verification and validation of the Samsung Reconfigurable Processor",
    "abstract": "This paper describes a framework to verify the functional correctness of the Samsung Reconfigurable Processor, a dual-mode very-long instruction word (VLIW) and coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) processor integrated in smartphones, cameras, printers, and SmartTVs. Reflecting the reconfigurable nature of the processor, the test generator constructs an  architectural model  directly from the processorâ€™s high-level hardware description files. Test programs are specified in a custom Constraint Specification Language that allows full coverage tests as well as verification of corner cases. Operations and operands are mapped to the heterogeneous processing elements of the CGRA using a guided place-and-routing algorithm. Requiring no explicit knowledge about the semantics of operations, the presented framework seamlessly supports custom ISA extensions. Experiments demonstrate that the framework is versatile, efficient, and quickly achieves a high coverage. In addition to detecting all randomly inserted faults, the generated test programs also exposed two yet unknown actual faults in the architecture.",
