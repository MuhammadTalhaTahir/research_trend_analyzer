    "title": "A QoS-guaranteed online user data deployment method in edge cloud computing environment",
    "abstract": "App vendors now have a new way to deploy applications on edge servers thanks to the rise of edge  cloud computing . App vendors will be able to deliver better services to users throughout this form. Compared to the traditional centralized system, the new distributed  computing paradigm  constructs a novel cyber–physical–social system. However, how to design a data deployment method to meet the requirement of the CPS system is a challenge. A QoS-guaranteed edge user data deployment method needs to maximize the reduction in service latency and minimize the overall system cost (SC) with available resources. The EDD (edge data deployment) problem is formulated as an online problem and we propose a convinced method to solving this problem. We analyze the performance of our approach theoretically and conduct experiments to compare the proposed method to three different  baseline methods  with a real-word dataset. Our method’s efficiency and efficacy are shown by the experimental results.",
