    "title": "Blocking analysis of suspension-based protocols for parallel real-time tasks under global fixed-priority scheduling",
    "abstract": "With the wide use of  multiprocessor  architecture, parallel tasks have been receiving growing attention in both industry and academia. In real-time systems, the scheduling and  synchronization  that ensure predictable task execution and resource access are of  utmost importance . Although the scheduling of (independent) parallel tasks is widely studied in recent years, few works have been done for the  synchronization  with intra-task  parallelism . In particular, the performance of the classical  priority inheritance  mechanism is still unfathomed for parallel tasks. In this paper, we extend the Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP) and the Flexible Multiprocessor Locking Protocol (FMLP) for real-time parallel tasks (i.e., called P-PIP and P-FMLP respectively) under the global fixed-priority scheduling, and present the blocking analysis for both protocols with the state-of-the-art  linear optimization  technique. Empirical evaluations show that the P-PIP outperformed the P-FMLP with increasing shared  resource contentions .",
