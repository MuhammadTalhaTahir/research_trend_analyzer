    "title": "Improving Efficiency and Lifetime of Logic-in-Memory by Combining IMPLY and MAGIC Families",
    "abstract": "Memristor-based memory computing has attracted much attention recently. By combining the storability and computability of memristor devices together, the memristor-based in-memory computing could break the so-called von Neumann bottleneck. Logic-in-memory (LIM) aims at implementing any computing task in memory. IMPLY family and MAGIC family are two of the most popular stateful logic families of LIM. The two families have their own respective advantages and disadvantages. However, there is few work combining the two family gates together in a same memristor crossbar. In this paper, we would present X-IMPLY family gates that eliminates the required  external resistors  of conventional IMPLY family gates. We then show by combining X-IMPLY and MAGIC family gates, the advantages of both logic families are exploited. At last, we evaluate the proposed method on state-of-art benchmarks. The results show, averagely, our method saves more than 15% of cell usage and is more than 22% faster and increases lifetime by more than 41% compared with MAGIC SIMPLER for different size constrains of crossbar row/column.",
