    "title": "Distributed Age-of-Information optimization in edge computing for Internet of Vehicles",
    "abstract": "As an important concept to depict the freshness of an information when it arrives at the destination, the Age-of-Information (AoI) and its relative scheduling works can be a very useful tool to aggregate the information from the end devices to the edge servers in  Internet of Vehicles , which can strongly support those time-sensitive services in  intelligent transportation system . However, most of the previous works about the AoI scheduling on  edge computing  are the centralized ones, rely on the reliable communications, and ignore the mobility of vehicles, which may not suit the dynamic environment in Internet of Vehicles. In this paper, we consider the AoI  optimization problem  in a more comprehensive vehicle model, and present a distributed AoI  optimization algorithm  based on a single hop end-to-edge wireless network. With an arbitrary power control technique, our algorithm reaches an asymptotically  optimal performance  on minimizing the expectation of AoI. Both of theoretical analysis and extensive simulations are conducted to verify the correctness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.",
