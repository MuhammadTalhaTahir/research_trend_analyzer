    "title": "Comparative performance evaluation of latency and link dynamic power consumption modelling algorithms in wormhole switching networks on chip",
    "abstract": "The simulation of interconnect architectures can be a time-consuming part of the design flow of on-chip multiprocessors. Accurate simulation of state-of-the art network-on-chip interconnects can take several hours for realistic application examples, and this process must be repeated for each  design iteration  because the interactions between design choices can greatly affect the overall throughput and latency performance of the system. This paper presents a series of network-on-chip transaction-level model (TLM) algorithms that provide a highly abstracted view of the process of data transmission in priority preemptive and non-preemptive networks-on-chip, which permit a major reduction in  simulation event  count. These simulation models are tested using two realistic application  case studies  and with  synthetic traffic . Results presented demonstrate that these lightweight TLM simulation models can produce latency figures accurate to within mere flits for the majority of flows, and more than 93% accurate link  dynamic power consumption  modelling, while simulating 2.5 to 3 orders of magnitude faster when compared to a cycle-accurate model of the same interconnect.",
