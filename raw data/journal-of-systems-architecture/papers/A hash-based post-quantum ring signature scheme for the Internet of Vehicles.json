    "title": "A hash-based post-quantum ring signature scheme for the Internet of Vehicles",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles, securing data transmission has become crucial, especially given the threat posed by quantum computing to traditional digital signatures. This paper presents a hash-based post-quantum ring signature scheme built upon the XMSS hash-based signature framework, leveraging Merkle trees for efficient data organization and verification. In addition, the scheme is applied to the Internet of Vehicles, ensuring both anonymity and traceability while providing robust quantum-resistant security. Evaluation results indicate that, compared to other schemes, the proposed method achieves superior verification speed while ensuring data security and privacy.",
