    "title": "Stochastic multi-objective Pareto-optimization framework for fully automated ab initio network-on-chip design",
    "abstract": "With the advent of multi-core processors, network-on-chip design has been crucial in addressing network performances, such as bandwidth,  power consumption , and communication delays when dealing with on-chip communication between the increasing number of processor cores. As the numbers of cores increase, network design becomes inherently more complex. Therefore, there is a critical need in soliciting computer aid in determining  network configurations  that afford  optimal performance  given multi-objectives, such as resource and design constraints. We have devised a stochastic multi-objective Pareto-optimization framework that fully automatically explores the space of possible network configurations to determine optimal  network latencies , power consumption, and the corresponding link allocations, i.e., the actual network-on-chip design, ab initio with only the number of routers given. For a given number of routers, average network latency and power consumption as example performance objectives can be displayed in form of Pareto-optimal fronts, thus not only offering a powerful automatic network-on-chip design tool, but also affording trade-off studies for the chip designers.",
