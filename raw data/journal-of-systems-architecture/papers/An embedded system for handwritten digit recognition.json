    "title": "An embedded system for handwritten digit recognition",
    "abstract": "The goal of this work is the design and implementation of a low-cost system-on-FPGA for  handwritten digit recognition , based on a relatively deep and wide network of  perceptrons . In order to increase the performance of the application on embedded processors whose performances are way below standard general purpose CPUs, a  regularization method  was used during the training phase of the  neural network  that allows for the drastic reduction of  floating point operations . Our implementation achieves a 3 Ã—  speed-up toward a raw implementation without optimization, while keeping the accuracy in acceptable ranges. Our efforts reinforce the fact that FPGAs are suited for deploying complex  artificial intelligence  modules.",
