    "title": "A survey of techniques for optimizing transformer inference",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a phenomenal rise in the performance and applications of transformer  neural networks . The family of transformer networks, including  Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer  (BERT), Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) and  Vision Transformer  (ViT), have shown their effectiveness across  Natural Language Processing  (NLP) and  Computer Vision  (CV) domains. Transformer-based networks such as  ChatGPT  have impacted the lives of common men. However, the quest for high  predictive performance  has led to an exponential increase in transformersâ€™ memory and compute footprint. Researchers have proposed techniques to optimize transformer inference at all levels of abstraction. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of techniques for optimizing the inference phase of transformer networks. We survey techniques such as  knowledge distillation , pruning, quantization,  neural architecture search  and lightweight network design at the algorithmic level. We further review hardware-level optimization techniques and the design of novel  hardware accelerators  for transformers. We summarize the quantitative results on the number of parameters/FLOPs and the accuracy of several models/techniques to showcase the tradeoff exercised by them. We also outline future directions in this rapidly evolving field of research. We believe that this survey will educate both novice and seasoned researchers and also spark a plethora of research efforts in this field.",
