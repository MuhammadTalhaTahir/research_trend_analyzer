    "title": "A survey and taxonomy on energy management schemes in wireless sensor networks",
    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with energy harvesting have fascinated the prospectus attention of researchers due to their wide deployment and omnipresent nature in the emerging areas of the Internet of Things (IoT's) and home automation. However, there are a lot of key challenges that affect the performance of  WSNs  due to their own characteristics. Still, energy constraints remain one of the major hurdles that need to be addressed. The best solution for bottleneck of energy constraints is energy management and harvesting schemes. The taxonomic survey puts the different schemes of energy management into classes that represent different application requirements. This research article provides a systematic taxonomy for energy management schemes in WSNs that examine various energy provisioning-based techniques. Various protocols/algorithms are summarized along with their remarkable implementation in different policies of energy management. Also, this survey study highlights progressing research activities and issues that affect the performance and deployment of WSNs.",
