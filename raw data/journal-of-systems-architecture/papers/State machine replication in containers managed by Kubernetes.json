    "title": "State machine replication in containers managed by Kubernetes",
    "abstract": "Computer  virtualization  brought fast  resource provisioning  to  data centers  and the deployment of pay-per-use cost models. The  system virtualization  provided by containers like Docker has improved this flexibility of resource provisioning. Applications that require more restrictive agreement and ordering guarantees can also benefit from operating inside containers. This paper proposes the integration of coordination services in a container  management system  called  Kubernetes  (k8s), seeking to restrict the containers’ size and to offer automatic  state replication . A protocol that uses shared memory available in Kubernetes was developed, and an evaluation was conducted to show the viability of the proposal.",
