    "title": "A Hidden Markov Model based smartphone heterogeneity resilient portable indoor localization framework",
    "abstract": "Indoor localization is an emerging application domain that promises to enhance the way we navigate in various indoor environments, as well as track equipment and people. Wireless signal-based fingerprinting is one of the leading approaches for indoor localization. Using ubiquitous Wi-Fi  access points  and Wi-Fi  transceivers  in smartphones has enabled the possibility of fingerprinting-based localization techniques that are scalable and low-cost. But the variety of Wi-Fi hardware modules and software stacks used in today's smartphones introduce errors when using Wi-Fi based fingerprinting approaches across devices, which reduces  localization accuracy . We propose a framework called  SHERPA-HMM  that enables efficient porting of indoor localization techniques across mobile devices, to maximize accuracy. An in-depth analysis of our framework shows that it can deliver up to 8Ã— more accurate results as compared to state-of-the-art localization techniques for a variety of environments.",
