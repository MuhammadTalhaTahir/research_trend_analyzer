    "title": "IoT Device security through dynamic hardware isolation with cloud-Based update",
    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel approach to provide comprehensive security to  IoT  devices. Our approach is based on a reconfigurable hardware-based isolation and protection mechanism (IPM) that operates as a dynamic separation unit between devices and network, far from potential software manipulation. The IPM analyses communications for  malicious activities  and prevents damage to the IoT device. The IPM leverages a central cloud-based authority to broaden the scope of traffic analysis beyond that of a singular IoT device. The central server evaluates logs from all IPM-protected IoT devices to improve their defense mechanisms and periodically upgrade device IPMs through a remote secure provisioning mechanism. The IPM achieves a 98.68% detection rate when evaluated against a Neptune DoS attack.",
