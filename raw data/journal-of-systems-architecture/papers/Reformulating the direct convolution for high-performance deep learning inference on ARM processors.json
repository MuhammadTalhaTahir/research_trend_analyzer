    "title": "Reformulating the direct convolution for high-performance deep learning inference on ARM processors",
    "abstract": "We present two high-performance implementations of the convolution operator via the direct algorithm that outperform the so-called  lowering  approach based on the  im2col  transform plus the  gemm  kernel on an ARMv8-based processor. One of our methods presents the additional advantage of zero-memory overhead while the other employs an additional yet rather moderate workspace, substantially smaller than that required by the  im2col + gemm  solution. In contrast with a previous implementation of a similar zero-memory overhead direct convolution, this work exhibits the key advantage of preserving the conventional NHWC data layout for the input/output activations of the convolution layers.",
