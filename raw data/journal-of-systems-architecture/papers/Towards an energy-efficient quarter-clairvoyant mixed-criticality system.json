    "title": "Towards an energy-efficient quarter-clairvoyant mixed-criticality system",
    "abstract": "Mode switch is the key strategy in mixed-criticality systems, enabling a dynamic balance between  system performance  and safety. Mode switch in conventional MCS frameworks is always triggered by  over-execution  of a task,  i.e. , a task overrunning the less pessimistic worst-case  execution time . In cyberâ€“physical systems, the data volume generated by I/O affects and even dominates task execution time. Based on this observation, we propose a novel MCS framework, named  Pythia -MCS, which predicts task execution time according to I/O run-time behaviors. With the new feature of  future-prediction ,  Pythia -MCS provides more timely, but still accurate, mode switches. We specifically introduce the  Pythia -MCS design methods, including different allocations of I/O monitoring and an efficient  energy management  framework. We present a new theoretical model ( quarter-clairvoyance ), which guarantees the timing predictability of the design, and a new  schedulability analysis  for  Pythia -MCS, which demonstrates improved schedulability compared to conventional MCS frameworks. In addition,  Pythia -MCS is comprehensively evaluated using a number of metrics.",
