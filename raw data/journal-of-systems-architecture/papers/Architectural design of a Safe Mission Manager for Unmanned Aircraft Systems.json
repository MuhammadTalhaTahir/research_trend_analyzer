    "title": "Architectural design of a Safe Mission Manager for Unmanned Aircraft Systems",
    "abstract": "Civil Aviation  Authorities are elaborating a new regulatory framework for the safe operation of  Unmanned Aircraft Systems  (UAS). Current proposals are based on the analysis of the specific risks of the operation as well as on the definition of some risk  mitigation measures . In order to achieve the target level of safety, we propose increasing the level of automation by providing the on-board system with Automated Contingency Management functions. The aim of the resulting Safe Mission Manager System is to autonomously adapt to contingency events while still achieving mission objectives through the degradation of mission performance. In this paper, we discuss some of the architectural issues in designing this system. The resulting architecture makes a conceptual differentiation between event monitoring, decision-making on a policy for dealing with contingencies and the execution of the corresponding policy. We also discuss how to allocate the different Safe Mission Manager components to a partitioned,  Integrated Modular Avionics  architecture. Finally, determinism and predictability are key aspects in contingency management due to their overall impact on safety. For this reason, we model and verify the correctness of a contingency management policy using formal methods.",
