    "title": "Enhanced Gaussian mixture model of RSSI purification for indoor positioning",
    "abstract": "Received Signal  Strength  Indicator (RSSI) is used in indoor positioning for measuring object distance to the  base station . However, acquiring accurate RSSI values is challenging due to wireless interferences, especially multipath decline. Therefore, RSSI purification is critical so we propose an Enhanced  Gaussian Mixture Model  (EGMM) for accurate indoor positioning. EGMM improves  Gaussian filter  based on  Gaussian Mixture Model  (GMM) to identify the desirable Light of Sight (LOS) signals from multipath decline signals. EGMM integrates GMM with  Akaike information criterion  (AIC) to determine the best K value for GMM and filter the LOS signal set accurately. The experiment is conducted with iBeacon devices, and the average  error distance  of EGMM can be enhanced as 64% of those generated by existing Gaussian filtering. The average positioning error of EGMM is about 0.48â€¯m, which is adequate for indoor positioning.",
