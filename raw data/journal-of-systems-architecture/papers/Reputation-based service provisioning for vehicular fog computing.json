    "title": "Reputation-based service provisioning for vehicular fog computing",
    "abstract": "The startling rise in smart vehicles stimulates the rapid development of new paradigms such as Social  Internet of Vehicle  (SIoV) and Vehicular  Fog Computing  (VFC). Trustworthiness has been regarded as a dominating issue in all the have-to-be-addressed issues in SIoV, and many reputation-based countermeasures have been adopted to solve the trustiness-related issues in IoV. However, little attention has been paid to the reputation of vehicles when they provision  computational resources  in VFC, which is worthy of further investigation since some fog vehicles pursue more revenues or fewer costs at the expense of delivering poor-quality computing services. Such selfish behaviors should be discouraged. In this paper, we put forward a reputation-based  service provisioning  scheme, and a reputation management scheme consisting of the decentralized reputation updating and global reputation  synchronization  in VFC, aiming to prevent the fog vehicles from delivering low-quality computing services by maximizing the accumulated reputation of all the serving fog vehicles in the optimization period. An online approach is adopted to handle the requests in a slot-by-slot way. The simulation results show its effectiveness and advantages when compared to other existing approaches.",
