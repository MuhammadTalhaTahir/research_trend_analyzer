    "title": "The BH-mixed scheduling algorithm for DAG tasks with constrained deadlines",
    "abstract": "The development of real-time systems has stimulated studies of real-time scheduling algorithms and  schedulability analysis  methods for parallel tasks, whose number has increased from year to year. For parallel tasks that cannot be converted to sequential tasks, the existing scheduling strategies mostly use one scheduling strategy. From the experiment results when we use different scheduling strategies to schedule the same tasks, we can observe these strategies have advantages for tasks with specific parameter characteristics. We combine the  strengths  of three algorithms: the partitioned algorithm, the federated  scheduling algorithm  and the GFP algorithm. A BH-Mixed scheduling algorithm for directed acyclic graph tasks with constrained deadlines is proposed in this paper. We design a classification method according to the feature of these three algorithms. The tasks are divided into three groups and scheduled by the partitioned algorithm, the federated scheduling algorithm and the GFP algorithm respectively. Experimental results show that the BH-Mixed scheduling algorithm outperforms other algorithms tested in this paper.",
