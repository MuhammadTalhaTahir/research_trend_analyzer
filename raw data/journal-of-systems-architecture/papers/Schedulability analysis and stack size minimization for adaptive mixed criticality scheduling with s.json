    "title": "Schedulability analysis and stack size minimization for adaptive mixed criticality scheduling with semi-Clairvoyance and preemption thresholds",
    "abstract": "In cost-sensitive Mixed-Criticality Systems (MCS) such as automotive Electrical/Electronic (E/E) systems, it is important to reduce application  memory footprint , since such a reduction may enable significant cost savings due to adoption of cheaper processor models. Preemption Threshold Scheduling (PTS) is an effective technique for controlling the degree of preemption and reducing system stack usage of a multitasking system under priority-based scheduling. In this paper, we present a schedulability test to enable integration of Preemption Threshold Scheduling (PTS) and Adaptive Mixed Criticality (AMC) scheduling with Semi-Clairvoyance, which can be used by high-level optimization algorithms with different possible optimization objectives, including improving schedulability and reducing system stack usage of an MCS. The experimental results indicate that our approach results in significant benefits in terms of improving schedulability and reducing system stack usage compared to state-of-the-art.",
