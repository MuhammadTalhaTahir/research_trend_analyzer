    "title": "A systematic methodology to migrate complex real-time software systems to multi-core platforms",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a systematic three-stage methodology for migrating complex real-time industrial software systems from single-core to multi-core computing platforms. Single-core platforms have limited computational capabilities that prevent integration of computationally demanding applications such as image processing within the existing system. Modern multi-core processors offer a promising solution to address these limitations by providing increased computational power and allowing parallel execution of different applications within the system. However, the transition from traditional single-core to contemporary multi-core computing platforms is non-trivial and requires a systematic and well-defined migration process. This paper reviews some of the existing migration methods and provides a systematic multi-phase migration process with emphasis on software architecture recovery and transformation to explicitly address the timing and dependability attributes expected of industrial software systems. The methodology was evaluated using a survey-based approach and the results indicate that the presented methodology is feasible, useable and useful for real-time industrial software systems.",
