    "title": "A survey and taxonomy of congestion control mechanisms in wireless network on chip",
    "abstract": "Wireless network on chip (WiNoC) has been proposed as a promising solution for on-chip interconnection network due to high scalability, high bandwidth, and low latency. However, the variations of traffic pattern distribution and data flow lead to congestion in wireless interfaces-equipped routers (WRs). Congestion is one of the main challenges in emerging WiNoCs that can reduce network performance. In recent years, various researches have been proposed to decrease congestion in WiNoCs. However, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of the significant congestion control mechanisms in WiNoCs. The available schemes are classified into six categories, includeing hardware resources-based congestion control, congestion-aware routing algorithms, medium access control protocol,congestion-aware architectures, rate-based congestion control, and application-mapping with task-migration techniques. The goal of this survey is to highlight the characteristics and inherent constraints of congestion control mechanisms in a novel approach that can help researchers for designing efficient congestion control scheme.",
