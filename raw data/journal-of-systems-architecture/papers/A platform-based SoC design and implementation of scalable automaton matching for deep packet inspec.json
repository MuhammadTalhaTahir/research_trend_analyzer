    "title": "A platform-based SoC design and implementation of scalable automaton matching for deep packet inspection",
    "abstract": "String matching plays a central role in  packet inspection  applications such as  intrusion detection , anti-virus, anti-spam and Web filtering. Since they are computation and memory intensive, software  matching algorithms  are insufficient to meet the high-speed performance. Thus, offloading packet inspection to a dedicated hardware seems inevitable. This paper presents a scalable  automaton  matching (SAM)  coprocessor  that uses Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with two parallel acceleration techniques, root-indexing and pre-hashing. The root-indexing can match multiple bytes in one single matching, and the pre-hashing can be used to avoid bitmap AC matching which is a cycle-consuming operation. In the platform-based  SoC  implementation of the Xilinx ML310  FPGA , the proposed hardware architecture can achieve almost 10.7 Â  Gbps and support over 10,000 patterns for virus, which is the largest pattern set from among the existing works. On the average, the performance of SAM is 7.65 times faster than the original bitmap AC. Furthermore, SAM is feasible for either internal or external memory architecture. The internal memory architecture provides high performance, while the external memory architecture provides high scalability in term of the number of patterns.",
