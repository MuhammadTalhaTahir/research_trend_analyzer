    "title": "Configurable parallel memory architecture for multimedia computers",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel parallel memory architecture for multimedia computers. Applying a configurable or programmable addressing circuitry capable of parallel memory accesses, the  memory management  of  multimedia applications  can be enhanced. Necessary  computer architecture  changes to virtual address representation, paging, virtual memory, address computation circuitry and data permutation are discussed. These changes allow the memory to be partitioned for different access functions. In addition, the same memory area can be accessed by  multiple access  patterns. Therefore, a general-purpose computing system that is capable of exploiting the repeating  memory access patterns  in its applications can be built. Performance of the configurable parallel memory architecture (CPMA) is analyzed in the case of a selection of algorithms from a  video encoder . These  motion estimation algorithms  and zigzag scanning benefit from the multiple memory access functions, which is apparent from the comparisons to the traditional sequential memory accesses.",
