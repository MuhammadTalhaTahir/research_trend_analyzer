    "title": "Clustering scheduling for hardware tasks in reconfigurable computing systems",
    "abstract": "Reconfigurable computing  systems have been used widely in various areas due to their attractive features in low-power and high-precision. However, how to increase utilization and throughput while reducing configuration and  execution time  overheads on large-scale data has become a great challenge for reconfigurable computing systems. In this paper, we employ a  directed acyclic graph  (DAG) to represent the tasks in an application. With considerations of  task dependencies  and  resource constraints  that are not sufficiently studied in literature, we propose two clustering scheduling strategies to reduce the number of configurations and the execution time of applications, while enhancing the utilization of  field programmable gate array  (FPGA) devices: One is a heuristic scheduling strategy and the other is a  dynamic programming  scheduling strategy. Experimental results indicate that our  dynamic programming  scheduling strategy can significantly reduce the number of configurations and improve the FPGA utilization, compared to the heuristic scheduling strategy.",
