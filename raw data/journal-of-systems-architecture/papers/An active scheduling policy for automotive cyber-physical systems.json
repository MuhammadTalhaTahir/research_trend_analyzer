    "title": "An active scheduling policy for automotive cyber-physical systems",
    "abstract": "The multi-functional mixed-criticality automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPS) refer to multiple functions with several levels of  criticality  that can be run on a same platform, in which heterogeneous  electronic control units  (ECU) that are distributed on multiple network buses. Well-designed schedule policy for the system criticality of these systems can improve the  system performance  and reduce the deadline miss ratio. In this paper, we propose a  scheduling algorithm  called fairness and active multiple heterogeneous earliest finish time (FA_MHEFT) to meet the deadlines of high-criticality functions as soon as possible. FA_MHEFT actively adjusts the criticality of the system at the task level and reduces the delay of tasks in low-criticality functions when high-criticality scheduling is performed. With a more active scheduling policy, FA_MHEFT can reduce the overall makespan of the system and the deadline miss ratio (DMR) of the functions. Our experiments validate that FA_MHEFT can reduce the DMR of a high-criticality level function and improve system performance compared with other existing scheduling methods.",
