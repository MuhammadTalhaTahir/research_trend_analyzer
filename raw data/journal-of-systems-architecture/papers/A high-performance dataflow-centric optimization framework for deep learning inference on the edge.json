    "title": "A high-performance dataflow-centric optimization framework for deep learning inference on the edge",
    "abstract": "Edge computing  has been emerging as a popular scenario for model inference. However, the inference performance on edge devices (e.g., Multi-Core  DSP , FGPA, etc.) suffers from inefficiency due to the lack of highly optimized inference frameworks. Previous model inference frameworks are mainly developed in an operator-centric way, which provides insufficient acceleration to edge-based inference. Besides, the operator-centric framework incurs significant costs for continuous development and maintenance. Targeting the existing drawbacks of  operator-centric  frameworks, we design  Xenos , which can automatically conduct  dataflow-centric  optimization of the  computation graph  and accelerate inference in two dimensions. Vertically,  Xenos  develops operator linking technique to improve  data locality  by restructuring the inter-operator dataflow. Horizontally,  Xenos  develops DSP-aware  operator split  technique to enable higher  parallelism  across multiple  DSP  units. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of vertical and horizontal dataflow optimization, which reduce the inference time by 15.0%–84.9% and 17.9%–89.9% , respectively. Besides,  Xenos  also outperforms the widely-used TVM by 1.1 × –1.9 × . Moreover, we extend  Xenos  to a distributed solution, which we call  d-Xenos .  d-Xenos  employs multiple edge devices to jointly conduct the inference task and achieves a speedup of 3.68 × –3.78 ×  compared with the single device.",
