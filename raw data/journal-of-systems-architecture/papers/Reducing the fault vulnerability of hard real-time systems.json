    "title": "Reducing the fault vulnerability of hard real-time systems",
    "abstract": "With the progress of the technology, the presence of  transient faults  (e.g. bit-flipping errors) in cache memories becomes a challenge, especially in embedded real-time systems. These are mission  critical systems  that are often subject to both fault-tolerant and real-time constraints. To reduce the impact of transient faults,  hardware protection  mechanisms are usually proposed. However, these mechanisms introduce too much  pessimism  in the computation of the worst-case  execution time  of a task, decreasing the overall  system performance . In this paper, we propose a methodology to evaluate and reduce the vulnerability of hard real-time applications to soft errors in  IL1 cache  memories. We use  static analysis  tools to analyze a binary program and compute the overall vulnerability of its instructions. Then, we propose to reduce this vulnerability by invalidating some cache blocks at specific instants during the execution, thus forcing vulnerable instruction blocks to be reloaded from higher layers of memory. Since adding invalidation points will likely increase the WCETs of the tasks, we perform a static analysis to guarantee that the application deadlines are respected Finally, we analyze how our methodology can be combined with hardware protection mechanisms as  ECC  memories, and we evaluate the performance on a set of benchmarks.",
