    "title": "Translating a large subset of stateflow to hybrid CSP with code optimization",
    "abstract": "Stateflow is a graphical language for  modeling hierarchical  transition systems, well-known for the complexity of its semantics, which is only informally explained in its user manual. Formal analysis and verification of Stateflow models usually proceed by first translating a subset of Stateflow to a formal language with precise semantics. Most existing work address only “safe” subset of Stateflow and ignore the most complex semantic issues. Moreover, it is difficult to balance simplicity of the translation algorithm with  conciseness  of the resulting model. In this paper, we describe a two-stage process for translating a large subset of Stateflow to Hybrid  CSP , where the first stage is mostly syntax-directed and addresses each feature of Stateflow separately, and the second stage is a  code optimization  step that simplifies the resulting model using information from  static analysis . We further incorporate this method into translation of  Simulink  models, in particular consider Stateflow charts triggered by various signal sources and function calls. The translation process is thoroughly validated using a hand-designed set of benchmarks, as well as larger  case studies  from existing work.",
