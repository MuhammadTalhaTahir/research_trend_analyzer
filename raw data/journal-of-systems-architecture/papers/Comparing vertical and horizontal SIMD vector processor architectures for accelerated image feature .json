    "title": "Comparing vertical and horizontal SIMD vector processor architectures for accelerated image feature extraction",
    "abstract": "Embedded automotive  Computer Vision  systems for real-time motion tracking and  3D scene  reconstruction demand for high  image feature  extraction performance and have a heavily constrained energy budget unable to be met by general-purpose CPUs and  GPUs . Due to the required programming flexibility for software updates and algorithmic extensions, the use of fully dedicated  hardware accelerators  is not advisable in most cases. In this paper, a  vertical  and a  horizontal   SIMD  vector processor architecture are implemented and compared for accelerating the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform feature extraction algorithm, exploiting inherent data-level  parallelism  prevalent in this application and considering different programming code strategies for the different vectorization paradigms. An evaluation for a 45 nm  ASIC  technology shows an overall performance gain of up to 24.8x, and up to 151.3x higher total performance-area-energy efficiency compared to a reference scalar two-issue VLIW processor. Compared to other implementations on programmable  ASIP  and mobile GPU platforms, the proposed  vertical  SIMD vector processor achieves a performance gain of up to 5.1x and up to 31.3x higher performance-energy efficiency.",
