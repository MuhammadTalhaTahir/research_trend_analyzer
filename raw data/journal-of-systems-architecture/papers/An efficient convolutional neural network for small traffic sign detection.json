    "title": "An efficient convolutional neural network for small traffic sign detection",
    "abstract": "Deep learning  has become a ubiquitous method in object detection among multiple domains recently. However, in the era of  edge computing , deploying  deep neural networks  on mobile edge platforms are challenging due to long latency and huge computational cost. As previous research efforts were usually focused on accuracy, achieving the balance between computational consumption and accuracy is a more significant problem to be tackled in  mobile edge computing  domain. To this end, we proposed an efficient  convolutional neural network  (CNN), which can remarkably minimize the redundancy, reduce the parameters and speed up the networks. The effectiveness of the network is further proved with experiments on a Tsinghua-Tencent 100K traffic sign dataset. Results show that under the same-level model size, our network outperforms the state-of-the-art Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN with 10% improvement in accuracy. Compared to similar work, the computational consumption on running time and memory of our network has been also reduced in the premise of little loss in accuracy.",
