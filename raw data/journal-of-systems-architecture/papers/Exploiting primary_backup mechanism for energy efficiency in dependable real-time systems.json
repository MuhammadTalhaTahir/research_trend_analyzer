    "title": "Exploiting primary/backup mechanism for energy efficiency in dependable real-time systems",
    "abstract": "Primary/Backup has been well studied as an effective fault-tolerance technique. In this paper, with the objectives of tolerating a single  permanent  fault and maintaining system reliability with respect to  transient  faults, we study dynamic-priority based energy-efficient fault-tolerance  scheduling algorithms  for periodic real-time tasks running on  multiprocessor systems  by exploiting the primary/backup technique while considering the negative effects of the widely deployed  Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling  (DVFS)  on  transient faults . Specifically, by separating primary and backup tasks on their dedicated processors, we first devise two schemes based on the idea of  Standby-Sparing (SS) : For  Paired-SS , processors are organized as groups of two (i.e., pairs) and the existing SS scheme is applied within each pair of processors after partitioning tasks to the pairs. In  Generalized-SS , processors are divided into two groups (of potentially different sizes), which are denoted as  primary  and  secondary \nprocessor groups, respectively. The main (backup) tasks are scheduled on the primary (secondary) processor group under the  partitioned-EDF  ( partitioned-EDL ) with DVFS (DPM) to save energy. Moreover, we propose schemes that allocate primary and backup tasks in a  mixed  manner to better utilize system slack on all processors for more  energy savings . On each processor, the  Preference-Oriented Earliest Deadline (POED) \nscheduler is adopted to run primary tasks at scaled frequencies  as soon as possible (ASAP)  and backup tasks at the maximum frequency  as late as possible (ALAP)  to save energy. Our empirical evaluations show that, for systems with a given number of processors, there normally exists a configuration for Generalized-SS with different number of processors in primary and backup groups, which leads to better energy savings when compared to that of the Paired-SS scheme. Moreover, the POED-based schemes normally have more stable performance and can achieve better energy savings.",
