    "abstract": "Cluster-based scheduling is recently gaining importance to be applied to mixed-criticality real-time systems on multicore processors platform. In this approach, the cores are grouped into clusters, and tasks that are partitioned among different clusters are scheduled by global scheduler in each cluster. This  research work  introduces a new cluster-based task allocation scheme for the mixed-criticality real-time task sets on multicore processors. For task allocation, smaller clusters sizes (sub-clusters) are used for mixed-criticality tasks in low criticality mode, while relatively larger cluster sizes are used for high criticality tasks in high criticality mode. In this research paper, the mixed-criticality task set is allocated to clusters using worst-fit heuristic. The tasks from each cluster are also allocated to its sub-clusters, using the same worst-fit heuristic. A fixed-priority response time analysis approach based on Audsleyâ€™s approach is used for the schedulability analysis of tasks in each cluster and sub-cluster. If the high criticality job is not completed after its  worst case execution time  in low mode, then the system is switched to high criticality mode. After mode switch, all the low criticalities tasks are discarded and only high criticality tasks are further executed in high criticality mode. Simulation results indicate that the percentage of schedulable task sets significantly increases under cluster scheduling as compared to partitioned and global mixed-criticality scheduling schemes.",
