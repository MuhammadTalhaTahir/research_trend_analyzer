    "abstract": "The identification of abnormal  power consumption  state is an important but difficult issue in power consumption. The State Grid Corporation of Chinaâ€™s electric energy data acquisition system is only capable of acquiring power consumption  big data  collected by smart energy meter terminals. In view of this fact, this study presents a method for identifying abnormal power consumption state. First, the  spectral distribution  of eigenvalues of the  covariance matrix  of the high-dimensional random matrix of massive volumes of power consumption data is analyzed based on high-dimensional random  matrix theory . Then, a power consumption big data-based abnormal power consumption state identification method is proposed based on the statistical properties of random matrices. Finally, simulations are performed based on actual power consumption data from  Guizhou Province , China. The simulation results show that the proposed method can not only satisfy urgent requirements of power grids for visualization, timeliness, reliability and security but also provide a new approach for data-driven smart visual monitoring of power consumption.",
