    "title": "Efficient location privacy-preserving range query scheme for vehicle sensing systems",
    "abstract": "Vehicle sensing systems (VSS) has received widespread concern in recent years. However, implementing data query efficiently while protecting data privacy in VSS is a challenge. Our work introduces an efficient location privacy-preserving range query (ELPRQ) scheme for secure  VSS communications . Specifically, ELPRQ combines privacy-preserving  scalar product  protocol to blur the  location information  and sensed data, so that no one but data requester and data uploading vehicle know their own  sensitive information . Detailed security analysis indicates that ELPRQ can resist all kinds of security threats and protect location privacy. Meanwhile, the performance evaluations demonstrate that ELPRQ is more efficient than the reported scheme with respect to computation complexity and  communication overhead .",
