    "title": "Task allocation, migration and scheduling for energy-efficient real-time multiprocessor architectures",
    "abstract": "Power consumption is becoming complicated to tackle each day in the embedded systems industry. As the demand for speed and accuracy increases, so does the power consumption of these systems. While introduction of  multiprocessors  have been shown to reduce the power problem compared to a uni-processor, researchers have tried to attain results using methods such as voltage and frequency scaling and scheduling methods. As an extension of these methods,  task migration  can be used to further reduce the power consumption of multiprocessor architectures. This article introduces a three-part framework to energy reduction of applications on a multiprocessor through an effective task allocation technique followed by task migration and finally a proper  task scheduling  scheme based on the earliest deadline first (EDF) method. Our experimental results showed great improvement over multiple state of the art energy reduction methods in the literature especially in the case of higher system workload over a range of underlying  system architectures .",
