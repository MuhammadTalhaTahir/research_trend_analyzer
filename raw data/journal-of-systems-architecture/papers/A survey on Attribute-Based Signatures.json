    "title": "A survey on Attribute-Based Signatures",
    "abstract": "Attribute-Based Signature (ABS), where messages are signed concerning a signing strategy conveyed as predicates, provides a necessary platform for implementing fine-grained access control over signed messages in an attribute-based  cryptosystem . Research into ABS has seen rapid progress in recent years, and we consider it a fitting proposition to achieve  anonymous authentication . Due to its unique characteristic, ABS is widely adopted in various application scenarios. Considering the fruitful and compelling prospect of ABS, it is desirable to survey the ABS systematically and thoroughly. This paper offers an exhaustive survey and examines the state-of-the-art of ABS designs and schemes. Furthermore, the survey proffers precise insights into some classic concretely constructed algorithms as well as the design philosophy behind these algorithms. Additionally, we examine the extensions (the several directions) of ABS and its advancement after its inception. We compare related work from the perspectives of performance, functionality, and  security level  and discuss  open research  issues.",
