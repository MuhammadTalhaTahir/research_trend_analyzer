    "title": "Energy efficient EDF-VD-based mixed-criticality scheduling with shared resources",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider simultaneously energy consumption and resource  synchronization  in mixed-criticality (MC) single processor systems. First, we give a  feasibility analysis  of single processor systems that execute real-time MC tasks. Second, an energy efficient speed based on sufficient feasibility condition is computed. In addition, we propose a single speed energy efficient algorithm for MC tasks with  shared resources  (ASS). The ASS algorithm scheduling tasks with  S L O  is too conservative with much room to save more energy. For energy efficiency, dual speeds  scheduling algorithm  (DSS) based on ASS algorithm is proposed. It schedules tasks at  S L O  with blocking and  S L O ′  without blocking. Blocking means that the higher priority tasks cannot preempt the execution of current low-priority tasks because low-priority tasks occupy the shared resources required for the higher priority tasks. Moreover, we prove that the DSS algorithm is feasible. Finally, the real-life synthetic application and extensive simulation are applied to validate the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the DSS algorithm can reduce energy consumption up to 11.82% compared with the existing approaches.",
