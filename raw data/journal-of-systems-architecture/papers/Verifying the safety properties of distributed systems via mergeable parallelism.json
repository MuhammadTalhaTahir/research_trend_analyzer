    "title": "Verifying the safety properties of distributed systems via mergeable parallelism",
    "abstract": "With the development of network technology and the increasing popularity of distributed systems, the society pays more and more attention to the reliability of distributed systems. Distributed systems establish services and communications among a large number of terminals, and message passing is a common communication method in distributed systems. In practice, asynchronous mode has better performance than synchronous mode, but asynchronous completion makes the task of specifying correct behaviors more difficult. Verification of asynchronous distributed systems is challenging due to unpredictable interleaving and possible network failures. Aiming to verify the safety properties of asynchronous programs, we propose a simple procedure with the assumption of mergeable  parallelism  in this paper. Then we characterize inference rules to describe the sequence combination that satisfies the conditions of the receive operations. The programâ€™s execution can be reduced to executions with sets of fixed order. A proof is provided to show its soundness. The correctness of the mergeable message passing programs could be verified by a state-of-the-art verification framework. Experimental results show that our method is efficient and applicable in various message passing cases.",
