    "title": "A novel authentication scheme for edge computing-enabled Internet of Vehicles providing anonymity and identity tracing with drone-assistance",
    "abstract": "As an element of the network edge for the smart city, the smart vehicle with computation capability undertakes information collection and transmission and serves as a node of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). It is emergent to keep available communication for IoV in rural or disaster areas under 5G/beyond 5G environments, where drones play a critical part in the above cases. Also, edge computing is a good method to complete the incentive computing for high-speed vehicles. In this paper, an authentication scheme is constructed for an edge computing-enabled Internet of Vehicles with drone assistance. The vehicles can keep their identities anonymous in the data transmission. The roadside unit, as the mobile edge computing server, deals with data from vehicles. If any vehicleâ€™s identity is required, the trusted authority will disclose it via the corresponding message. The formal proof demonstrates that the messages between participants cannot be forged by the attacker. Compared with some recent schemes of drone-assisted IoV, our scheme is the only one that maintains all security features. Moreover, our scheme is sound and practical via the expression of performance discussion and network simulation.",
