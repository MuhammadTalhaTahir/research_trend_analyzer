    "title": "Asynchronous vs. synchronous interfacing to time-triggered communication systems",
    "abstract": "Time-triggered communication facilitates the construction of multi-component real-time systems whose components are in control of their  temporal behaviour . However, the interface of a time-triggered  communication system  has to be accessed with care, to avoid that the temporal independence of components gets lost. This paper shows two interfacing strategies, one for asynchronous interface access (in two variants, one being the new  Rate-bounded Non-Blocking Communication  protocol) and one for time-aware, synchronized interface access, that allow components to maintain temporal independence. The paper describes and compares these interfacing strategies.",
