    "title": "Optimizing CAM-based instruction cache designs for low-power embedded systems",
    "abstract": "Energy consumption and  power dissipation  are important concerns in the design of embedded systems and they will become even more crucial with finer process geometry, higher frequencies,  deeper pipelines  and wider issue designs. In particular, the  instruction cache  consumes more energy than any other processor module, especially with commonly used highly associative CAM-based implementations. Two energy-efficient approaches for highly associative CAM-based  instruction cache  designs are presented by means of using a  segmented  wordline  and a predictor-based  instruction fetch  mechanism. The latter is based on the fact that not all instructions in a given I-cache fetch are used due to taken branches. The proposed  Fetch Mask Predictor  unit determines which instructions in a cache access will actually be used to avoid fetching any of the other instructions. Both proposed approaches are evaluated for an embedded 4-wide issue processor in 100   nm technology. Experimental results show average I-cache  energy savings  of 48% and overall processor energy savings of 19%.",
