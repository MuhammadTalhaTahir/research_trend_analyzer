    "title": "An architectural application framework for evolving distributed systems",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an object-oriented application framework to support the development of evolving distributed systems. The framework combines concepts of the object-oriented paradigm with those of  architectural design . The result is a framework which supports extensible and reusable configurations of distributed components. The framework addresses the problem of evolution by allowing the addition, replacement and extension of components of a configuration. Evolution is also possible at run time, where a configuration can change dynamically depending on a particular event. The paper outlines the fundamental aspects of our framework and presents a  case study , which illustrates its application.",
