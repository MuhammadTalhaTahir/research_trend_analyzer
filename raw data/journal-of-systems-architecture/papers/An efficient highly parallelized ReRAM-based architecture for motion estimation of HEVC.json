    "title": "An efficient highly parallelized ReRAM-based architecture for motion estimation of HEVC",
    "abstract": "Motion estimation (ME) is a  high efficiency video coding  (HEVC) process for determining  motion vectors  that describe the blocks transformation direction from one adjacent frame to a future frame in a video sequence. ME is a memory and computation consuming process which accounts for more than 50% of the total running time of HEVC. To conquer the memory and computation challenges, this paper presents ReME, a highly paralleled processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture for the ME process based on  resistive random access memory  (ReRAM). In ReME, the space of ReRAM is mainly separated into storage engine and ME processing engine. The storage engine is used as conventional memory to store video frames and intermediate data, while the computation operations of ME are performed in ME processing engines. Each ME processing engine in ReME consists of Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) modules, interpolation modules, and Sum of Absolute Transformed Difference (SATD) modules that transfer ME functions into ReRAM-based logic analog computation units. ReME further cooperates these basic computation units to perform ME processes in a highly parallel manner. Simulation results show that the proposed ReME accelerator significantly outperforms other implementations with time consuming and energy saving.",
