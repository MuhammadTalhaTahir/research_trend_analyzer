    "title": "A smart cyber physical multi-source energy system for an electric vehicle prototype",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a smart cyber physical multi-source  energy system  for electric vehicle applications. This system is realized in order to increase the autonomy of the vehicle as well as a good self-dispatch energy system. In this paper, three energy sources have modeled and integrated in the energy conversion chain of the vehicle. Moreover, the design of cyber energy dispatching system is proposed based on the  genetic algorithm  NSGA-II. Finally, the simulation and experimental results are demonstrated.",
