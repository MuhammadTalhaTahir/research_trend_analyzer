    "title": "Customization methodology for implementation of streaming aggregation in embedded systems",
    "abstract": "Streaming aggregation is a fundamental operation in the area of stream processing and its implementation provides various challenges. Data flow management is traditionally performed by  high performance computing  systems. However, nowadays there is a trend of implementing streaming operators in low power embedded devices, due to the fact that they often provide increased performance per watt in comparison with traditional high  performance systems . In this work, we present a methodology for the  customization  of streaming aggregation implemented in modern low power embedded devices. The methodology is based on  design space exploration  and provides a set of customized implementations that can be used by developers to perform trade-offs between throughput, latency, memory and energy consumption. We compare the proposed embedded system implementations of the streaming aggregation operator with the corresponding HPC and  GPGPU  implementations in terms of performance per watt. Our results show that the implementations based on low power embedded systems provide up to 54 and 14 times higher performance per watt than the corresponding Intel Xeon and Radeon HD 6450 implementations, respectively.",
