    "title": "A robust multiplexer-based FPGA inspired by biological systems",
    "abstract": "Biological organisms are among the most robust systems known to man. Their robustness is based on a set of processes which cannot be adapted directly to the world of silicon but can provide an inspiration for the design of robust circuits. This paper introduces a multiplexer-based Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) which we made capable of self-test and self-repair using an approach loosely based on biological mechanisms at the cellular level. The system is designed to provide on-line self-test and self-repair using a completely distributed system and a minimal amount of additional logic.",
