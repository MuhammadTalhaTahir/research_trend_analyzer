    "title": "Bit-accurate energy estimation for Networks-on-Chip",
    "abstract": "Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) are recognized as the solution to address the communication bottleneck in a Multi-processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC). As NoCs represent a significant part of  system consumption , MPSoC designers expect accurate power models in order to produce energy efficient systems. Nowadays, NoC simulators rely on power models that integrate link models without  crosstalk  modeling. In this study, we present Noxim-XT, a NoC simulator based on Noxim that embeds a link power model with  crosstalk  modeling. We show that the crosstalk effect has a deep impact on NoC energy consumption since our results demonstrate that classical models generate errors up to 45.5% on the whole NoC energy consumption estimation. In addition, this tool is able to run application-based traffic and we show that under application-based traffics, the energy estimation made by classical models overestimates the NoC energy consumption by up to 50%.",
