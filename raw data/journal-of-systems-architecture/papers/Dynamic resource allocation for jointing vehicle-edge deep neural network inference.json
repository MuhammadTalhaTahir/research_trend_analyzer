    "abstract": "The emergence of  mobile edge computing  provides an efficient and stable computing platform for intelligent applications of autonomous vehicles, and  deep neural network  (DNN) based tasks collaborative inference through  joint  device-edge is considered an effective way to reduce latency. However, the computing resources allocated to the vehicle are dynamic as the number of requesters changes due to the limitation of edge server resources, which causes the best partition point of the DNN is not fixed. In this paper, we consider a dynamic  resource allocation  scheme to select the best partition point of DNN inference tasks by vehicle-edge  collaborative computing . Specifically, the latency constrained DNN tasks of vehicles are partially offloaded to edge at the  granularity  of DNN layers. Considering the heterogeneity of vehicular computing capabilities and multiple DNN inference tasks, we formulate an  optimization problem  for  dynamic resource allocation  and automatically select the best partition point to minimize the overall latency of all vehicles, which is NP-hard. Then we design a chemical reaction optimization based algorithm for low complexity to solve the problem. The results of extensive evaluations illustrate that our proposed scheme is superior to other baseline schemes in terms of overall latency, and with lower failure rate.",
