    "title": "Symbolic identification of shared memory based bank conflicts for GPUs",
    "abstract": "Graphic processing units (GPUs) are routinely used for general purpose computations to improve performance. To achieve the sought performance gains, care must be invested in fine tuning the way GPU programs interact with the underlying architecture, accounting for the shared memory bank conflicts and the entailed shared memory transactions. Uncovering inputs leading to particular bank conflicts can turn out to be quite hard given the intricacy of the access patterns and their dependence on the inputs. We propose a symbolic execution based framework to systematically uncover shared memory bank conflicts, to propose inputs to realize a given number of shared memory transactions, and to refute the existence of such inputs if the number of shared memory transactions is impossible to achieve during the execution. This allows programmers to more formally reason about the shared memory conflicts and to validate their impact on performance and security. We have implemented our approach and report on our experiments to explore its usefulness towards performance enhancement and quantifying shared memory side-channel leakage in security applications.",
