    "title": "Designing a decentralized fault-tolerant software framework for smart grids and its applications",
    "abstract": "The vision of the ‘Smart Grid’ anticipates a distributed real-time embedded system that implements various monitoring and  control functions . As the reliability of the power grid is critical to modern society, the software supporting the grid must support  fault tolerance  and resilience of the resulting cyber-physical system. This paper describes the fault-tolerance features of a software framework called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid (RIAPS). The framework supports various mechanisms for fault detection and mitigation and works in concert with the applications that implement the grid-specific functions. The paper discusses the design philosophy for and the implementation of the fault tolerance features and presents an application example to show how it can be used to build highly resilient systems.",
