    "title": "A faster outsourced medical image retrieval scheme with privacy preservation",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of computer technology and  medical imaging  technology, medical images present an explosive growth. To save storage and computation overhead, hospitals often choose to outsource digital medical images to cloud server. Since medical images are a major  auxiliary  means for doctors’ diagnosis or medical researchers’ study, the secure retrieval of outsourced medical images is especially important. To address this problem, we propose a Faster outsourced Medical  Image Retrieval  scheme with  privacy preservation  (FMIR) in this paper. FMIR first makes a simple classification to outsourced medical images, which narrows the retrieval range and improves the retrieval efficiency compared with the existing unclassified retrieval schemes. Second, FMIR implements a lightweight  access control  for each class using polynomial-based access  control strategy , which provides the fine-grained access control for better privacy protection of medical images. Third, FMIR reduces the interference of  random numbers  on relevant score to 0, which further improves the accuracy of the retrieval. Finally, the security and performance analysis show that FMIR is secure, accurate and efficient.",
