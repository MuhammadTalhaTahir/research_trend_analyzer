    "title": "An Efficient Privacy-preserving Authentication Model based on blockchain for VANETs",
    "abstract": "The existing privacy-preserving  authentication  models for Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) primarily preserve multiple pseudonyms for one vehicle, while overlooking the consideration of confidential identity requirements. These authentication models cause pseudonyms management complex and  revocation  inconvenient.  Blockchain  seems to be suitable for storing the pseudonym certificates as transactions in the ledger, which enables distributed authentication. However, blockchain produces high latency for the membership verification of users. To tackle these problems, we present an Efficient Privacy-preserving Authentication Model (EPAM), leveraging the asynchronous accumulator to extend the blockchain application. The asynchronous accumulator supports efficient membership verification and avoids the time consuming of checking the  Certificate Revocation List  (CRL). Additionally, by designing a mutual  authentication protocol , we achieve privacy properties such as  anonymity  and unlinkability under the consideration of the semi-trust RSUs. The simulations show that the membership verification time is about 0.157ms in EPAM test over  1 0 7  certificates, thus alleviating the mutual authentication latency in VANETs.",
