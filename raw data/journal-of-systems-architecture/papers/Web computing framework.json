    "title": "Web computing framework",
    "abstract": "In this paper an approach to provide Web-based framework for distributed execution of collaborative applications is presented. The work is part of a wider on-going project whose aim is to make computing resources, both hardware and software, available to  Web users . The core of the system is the Web computing skeleton constructed from prefabricated Web-enabled components with the ability to open and maintain Internet connections and provide collaboration over the World Wide Web. A number of examples illustrate how Web presentation can be enriched with  collaborative software  using the Web computing framework.",
