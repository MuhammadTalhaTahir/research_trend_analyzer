    "title": "Multi-processor scheduling of elastic applications in compositional real-time systems",
    "abstract": "Scheduling of real-time applications modelled according to the periodic and the sporadic task model under hierarchical and compositional real-time systems has been widely studied to provide temporal isolation among independent applications running on shared resources. However, for some real-time applications which are amenable to variation in their timing behaviour, usage of these tasks models can result in pessimistic solutions. The elastic task model addresses this pessimism by allowing the timing requirements of an applicationâ€™s tasks to be specified as a range of values instead of a single value. Although the scheduling of elastic applications on dedicated resources has received considerable attention, there is limited work on scheduling of such applications in hierarchical and compositional settings. In this paper, we evaluate different earliest deadline first scheduling algorithms to schedule elastic applications in a minimum parallelism supply form reservation on a multiprocessor system. Our evaluation indicates that the proposed approach provides performance comparable to the current state-of-art algorithms for scheduling elastic applications on dedicated processors in terms of schedulability.",
