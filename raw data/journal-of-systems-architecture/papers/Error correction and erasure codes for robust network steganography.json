    "title": "Error correction and erasure codes for robust network steganography",
    "abstract": "Error correction and erasure codes and steganographic channels use related methods, but are investigated separately. We detail an idea from literature for a steganographic channel in a transmission with error correction code and experimentally investigate it with respect to bandwidth, robustness and detectability. We expand this construction to provide an example of multi-level steganography, i.e., a steganographic channel within a steganographic channel. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages on bandwidth and stealthyness that reversibility of such a steganographic channel brings, together with a new proposal for a covert channel in error-corrected data.",
