    "title": "Enhanced fault tolerant routing algorithms using a concept of “balanced ring”",
    "abstract": "Fault rings can be used to guide messages bypass faulty nodes/links in a fault tolerant  interconnection network . However, nodes on the fault ring become  hot spots , thus causing uneven distribution of the traffic loads. To avoid such traffic congestion, a concept of the balanced ring is proposed in this paper. The proposed balanced ring, defined as concentric rings of a given fault ring, can be applied to the  fault tolerant routing  algorithms for mesh and torus topologies. By properly guiding messages to route on the balanced ring and the fault ring, more balanced link utilization and greatly reduced traffic congestion can be achieved on a fault tolerant network. Methods of applying the balanced ring concept to some published fault tolerant  routing algorithms  are discussed. Proof of  deadlock  and livelock freedom is also presented. The use of balanced ring does not need to add new virtual channels. The performance of two  routing algorithms  with and without the balanced ring is simulated and evaluated. The results indicate that routing algorithms with the balanced rings constantly yield larger throughput and smaller latency than those without.",
