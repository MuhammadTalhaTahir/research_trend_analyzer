    "title": "A novel reconfigurable router for QoS guarantees in real-time NoC-based MPSoCs",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a proposal and implementation of a multi-mode full-reconfigurable router for Network-on-Chip (NoC). First, the router supports a hybrid packet-switching architecture that is dynamically reconfigurable to exchange between wormhole and virtual cut-through switching schemes at run-time. Therefore, it reaches a higher average performance than wormhole switching, while decreasing the implementation cost in comparison with the virtual cut-through switching. Second, the router is equipped a Quality-of-Services (QoS)-driven arbiter. Therefore, the proposed solution not only guarantees the guaranteed-throughput service without reserving resources but also enhances the average performance for the best-effort service by using network resources efficiently based on the  priority inheritance  arbitration mechanism. Third, the router is enhanced with the dynamically deadline-aware rerouting mechanism. In contention situation, the router can configure the routing computation unit to reroute the packet to another path so as to reduce the waiting interval of the blocked packets. The router was designed at the  Register Transfer Level  and modeled using VHDL language and then synthesized with Xilinx Virtex-7  FPGA  technology. The experimental results prove that the proposed router is reliable and can improve the average performance of different QoS loads significantly compared with the generic routers while the area and power overhead are acceptable.",
