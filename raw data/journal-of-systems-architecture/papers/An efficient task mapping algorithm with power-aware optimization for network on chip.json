    "title": "An efficient task mapping algorithm with power-aware optimization for network on chip",
    "abstract": "More and more cores are integrated onto a single chip to improve the performance and reduce the power consumption of CPU without the increased frequency. The cores are connected by lines and organized as a network, which is called network on chip (NOC) as the promising paradigm of the processor design. However, it is still a challenge to enhance performance with lower power consumption. The core issue is how to map the tasks to the different cores to take full advantages of the on-chip network. In this paper, we proposed a novel mapping algorithm with power-aware optimization for  NOC . The traffic of the tasks will be analyzed. The tasks of the same application with high communication with the others will be mapped to the on-chip network as neighborhoods. And then the tasks of different applications are mapped to the cores step by step. The mapping of the tasks and the cores is computed at run-time dynamically and implement online. The experimental results showed that this proposed algorithm can reduce the power consumption in communication and the performance enhanced.",
