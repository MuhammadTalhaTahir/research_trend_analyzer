    "title": "Privacy-preserving multi-party deep learning based on homomorphic proxy re-encryption",
    "abstract": "Deep learning  is an important branch of  artificial intelligence . However, the first task of deep learning is to collect data, which will seriously threaten user data privacy. The existing dual server privacy-preserving deep learning schemes operate under the assumption that two semi-honest servers will not collude, but this security assumption may be too robust. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving multiparty deep learning scheme based on a homomorphic proxy re-encryption scheme, which can resist collusion between the semi-honest servers. Introducing a fog node with high response and low latency characteristics as a proxy and leveraging a one-way homomorphic proxy re-encryption scheme to convert the user-end  ciphertext  to server-end  ciphertext  reduces the possibility of  privacy leakage  due to cooperation between two servers or participants and servers. To avoid a rise in the rounds of interaction caused by the increase in the number of participants, a multi-party  random numbers  aggregation method is proposed based on verifiable secret sharing. Ensuring the sensitive data remains undisclosed while enhancing the global modelâ€™s precision. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation have both demonstrated that this privacy-preserving deep learning scheme is equipped to handle multiple keys, resist collusion attacks, and achieve higher accuracy.",
