    "title": "A shortest path adaptive routing technique for minimizing path collisions in hybrid optical network-on-chip",
    "abstract": "Hybrid optical network-on-chip (HONoC) is a promising alternative to all-electrical NoC whose capability in the performance and the  power consumption  is facing ultimate physical limitation. However, the latency unfairness problem and the associated  performance degradation  due to the circuit switched characteristic of HONoC must be resolved. In this paper, we propose a new shortest path adaptive routing technique for HONoC by exploiting an elaborate rollback scheme and a rapid  flow control  method to promote the fast  routing path  setup and the parallel  data transfers . Compared to existing works, experimental results show reduction by 41.6% in latency and improvement by 16.9% in throughput with negligible extra energy consumption. Additional benefits in the network  resource utilization  and the performance under increasing network sizes are also analyzed.",
