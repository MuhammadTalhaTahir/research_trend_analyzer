    "title": "Design of an efficient VLSI architecture for non-linear spatial warping of wide-angle camera images",
    "abstract": "Endoscopic images are subjected to spatial distortion due to the wide-angle configuration of the camera lenses. This barrel type of non-linear distortion should be corrected before these images are subjected to further analysis for diagnostic purposes. An efficient digital architecture suitable for an embedded system which can correct the barrel distortion in real-time is presented in this paper. The theoretical approach of this spatial warping technique is based on least-squares estimation. The images in the distorted image space are mapped onto the corrected image space by using a polynomial mapping model. The polynomial parameters include the  expansion coefficients , back-mapping coefficients, distortion centre and corrected centre. Several experiments were conducted by applying the spatial warping algorithm on many endoscopic images. A digital architecture suitable for hardware implementation of the distortion correction technique is developed by mapping the algorithmic steps onto a linear array of  processing modules . Each module of a particular unit communicates with its nearest neighbours. The spatial warping architecture implemented and simulated with Altera’s Quartus II software shows an overall computation time of 1.8 ms with 50 MHz clock for an image of size 256   ×   192 pixels, which confirms that the spatial warping module could be mounted as a dedicated unit in an endoscopy system for real-time applications.",
