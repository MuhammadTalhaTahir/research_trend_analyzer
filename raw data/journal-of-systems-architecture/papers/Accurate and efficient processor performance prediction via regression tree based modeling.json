    "title": "Accurate and efficient processor performance prediction via regression tree based modeling",
    "abstract": "Computer architects usually evaluate new designs using cycle-accurate processor simulation. This approach provides a detailed insight into processor performance,  power consumption  and complexity. However, only configurations in a subspace can be simulated in practice due to long simulation time and limited resource, leading to suboptimal conclusions which might not be applied to a larger design space. In this paper, we propose a performance prediction approach which employs state-of-the-art techniques from experiment design,  machine learning  and  data mining . According to our experiments on single and multi-core processors, our prediction model generates highly accurate estimations for unsampled points in the design space and show the robustness for the worst-case prediction. Moreover, the model provides quantitative interpretation tools that help investigators to efficiently tune design parameters and remove  performance bottlenecks .",
