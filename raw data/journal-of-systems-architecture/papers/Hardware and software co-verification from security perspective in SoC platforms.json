    "title": "Hardware and software co-verification from security perspective in SoC platforms",
    "abstract": "Attacks which combine software and hardware vulnerabilities are emerging security problems. Although  runtime verification  or remote attestation can determine the correctness of program states on a processor core, existing methods rarely consider the software states on the whole  System on Chip  (SoC). Also, there are SoC level solutions focusing on addressing the threat in the RISC-V architecture, which provides an open  Instruction Set Architecture  (ISA) of the processor. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive software and hardware co-verification method to protect the entire RISC-V based SoC platform at runtime. The proposed method adopts the Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) framework to implement a new Verifier and Prover security architecture for supporting runtime software and hardware co-verification. This framework also considers the security states of third-party IPs (3PIPs). The framework is implemented as a  coprocessor , new bus and DIFT supported IP wrapper which does not change the architecture of the main processor core. The new security architecture can be integrated with other RISC-V processors. We implement a FPGA prototype on the Rocket-Chip, an RISC-V open-source processor core. The hardware overhead is 10% LUTs and 9.4% Flip-Flops and a performance overhead is 3%.",
