    "abstract": "Preserving the confidentiality and integrity of data transmission is paramount in the  Internet of Things  (IoT)-based healthcare systems. Current  encryption techniques  that allow plaintext checks primarily serve a specific  cryptosystem , lacking the adaptability to work with a diverse system incorporating various cryptographic methods. To address this, we present a unique online/offline heterogeneous signcryption scheme with plaintext checkable encryption (HOOSC-PCE). This approach enables the transition of signcrypted messages from an identity-based  cryptosystem  (IBC) to a  public key infrastructure  (PKI) system, improving information interoperability. A key aspect of our scheme is its capacity to allow cloud servers to perform plaintext queries, facilitating efficient data searches using plaintext keywords over  encrypted data . Furthermore, the signcryption process is divided into online and offline phases. The online phase handles tasks that require fewer resources, while the offline phase carries out more resource-intensive preparatory tasks. We rigorously tested the HOOSC-PCE schemeâ€™s security by proving it secure under the  Random Oracle Model  (ROM). Meanwhile, compared to similar work, it effectively reduces computation costs by 46.39%, 19.45%, 18.73%, and 13.25% across offline encryption, online encryption, decryption, and search algorithms. The results indicate that the HOOSC-PCE is secure and efficient, confirming its feasibility for IoT-based healthcare systems.",
