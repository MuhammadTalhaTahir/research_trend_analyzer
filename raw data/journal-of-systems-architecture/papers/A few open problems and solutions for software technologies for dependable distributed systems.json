    "title": "A few open problems and solutions for software technologies for dependable distributed systems",
    "abstract": "Software technologies are of paramount importance in the current and upcoming systems. In certain application domains, their design has to fit a difficult equation involving not only the expected functionality, but also broader dependable characteristics. Functional and non-functional characteristics have to adhere to requirements such as openness, adaptation, device heterogeneity, energy, or footprint. In this paper, we present a few challenges in some selected areas around the theme of  software technologies for dependable distributed systems . These selected areas are real-time, security in software forensics, and adaptation for cyber-physical systems from the perspective of the middleware. This serves as a context for the special issue in which this paper is contained, that gathers a set of valuable contributions in topics related to these domains. Lastly, we present a set of contributions that are part of this special issue that approach the problem from different perspectives.",
