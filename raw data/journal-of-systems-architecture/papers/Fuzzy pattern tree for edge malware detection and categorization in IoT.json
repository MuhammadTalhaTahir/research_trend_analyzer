    "abstract": "The surging pace of  Internet of Things  (IoT) development and its applications has resulted in significantly large amounts of data (commonly known as big data) being communicated and processed across IoT networks. While  cloud computing  has led to several possibilities in regard to this computational challenge, there are several security risks and concerns associated with it.  Edge computing  is a state-of-the-art subject in IoT that attempts to decentralize, distribute and transfer computation to IoT nodes. Furthermore, IoT nodes that perform applications are the primary target vectors which allow  cybercriminals  to threaten an IoT network. Hence, providing applied and robust methods to detect  malicious activities  by nodes is a big step to protect all of the network. In this study, we transmute the programsâ€™ OpCodes into a vector space and employ fuzzy and fast fuzzy pattern tree methods for  malware detection  and categorization. We obtained a high degree of accuracy during reasonable run-times especially for the fast fuzzy pattern tree. Both utilized feature extraction and  fuzzy classification , which were robust, led to more powerful edge computing malware detection and categorization method.",
