    "title": "Enabling real-time information service on telehealth system over cloud-based big data platform",
    "abstract": "A  telehealth system  covers both clinical and nonclinical uses, which not only provides store-and-forward  data services  to be offline studied by relevant specialists, but also monitors the real-time  physiological data  through ubiquitous sensors to support remote  telemedicine . However, the current telehealth systems do not consider the velocity and veracity of the big-data system in the medical context. Emergency events generate a large amount of the real-time data, which should be stored in the  data center , and forwarded to remote hospitals. Furthermore, patientsâ€™ information is scattered on the distributed  data center , which cannot provide a high-efficient remote real-time service. In this paper, we proposes a probability-based bandwidth model in a telehealth cloud system, which helps cloud broker to provide a high performance allocation of computing nodes and links. This brokering mechanism considers the location protocol of  Personal Health Record  (PHR)  in cloud and schedules the real-time signals with a low information transfer between different hosts. The broker uses several bandwidth evaluating methods to predict the near future usage of bandwidth in a telehealth context. The simulation results show that our model is effective at determining the best performing service, and the inserted service validates the utility of our approach.",
