    "title": "Side information-free low computational complexity TDSS-SLM transmission system",
    "abstract": "The authors propose the side information-free low-computational complexity Time Domain Sequence Superposition-Selected Mapping (TDSS-SLM) scheme for PAPR suppression. We adopt IFFT point reduction for transmitter and reception technique using pilot subcarriers for side information estimation. The simulation results show the TDSS-SLM transmitter achieves PAPR reduction of 2.3Â dB which corresponds to the 1.5 times larger PAE than that in the conventional transmitter. In addition, the proposed receiver shows loss-less BER performances for both AWGN channel and two types of fading channels, while the computational complexity of the proposed receiver is nearly the same as the conventional OFDM receiver, which is less than 1/10 of the ML receiver.",
