    "title": "Multi-level pulse position modulation scheme for enhancing link capacity in electromagnetic nanocommunication networks",
    "abstract": "In this letter, a new nanocommunication modulation scheme termed multi-level pulse position modulation (ML-PPM) is proposed. The ML-PPM approach will boost the link capacity of a nanocommunication system while achieving a processing gain in reception. The bit error rate and link capacity of the scheme are evaluated using a non-coherent energy detection nanoreceiver. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has a substantially greater link capacity than the existing schemes including time-spread onâ€“off keying (TS-OOK) and  M -ary pulse position modulation (PPM).",
