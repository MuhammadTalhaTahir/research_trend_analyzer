    "title": "Analysis of tree-shaped slotted impedance matching antenna for 60 GHz femtocell applications",
    "abstract": "Femtocell access point gives an efficient solution to furnish peak data rates in indoor wireless access systems. Propagation of the signal will get up-shot because of few considerations in advanced communication appliances. The maximum simulation reflection coefficient ( S 11 ) of proposed antenna is 45.12 dB, directivity is 6.54 dBi with the efficiency of 60% and at 60 GHz, and the measurement value of 36.35 is observed which covers the complete RADAR applications which have an unlicensed bandwidth. The proposed tree-shaped unequal slotted antenna is well suited for millimeter-wave applications because of its good bandwidth and less dimension.",
