    "title": "Some new RS-coded orthogonal modulation schemes for future GNSS",
    "abstract": "Considering the availability of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals and the increase in its data rate in the future, this paper proposes some new Reed-Solomon coded (RS-coded) orthogonal modulation schemes using the Hadamard codes, as an alternative to the RS-coded code-shift-keying (CSK) modulation in the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System L-band experimental (QZSS-LEX) signals. The simulation result of the proposed schemes shows that, though the frame size and hence the data rate is increased with much reduced complexity in the receiver, the bit error rate performance of RS-coded orthogonal modulation is slightly better than or comparable to the QZSS-LEX.",
