    "title": "Intrusion detection for network based cloud computing by custom RC-NN and optimization",
    "abstract": "Intrusion detection acts as a vital function in providing information security, and additionally the key technology is to precisely classify diverse attacks. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is identified as an important security issue within the cloud network environment. In this paper, IDS is given based on an innovative optimized custom RC-NN (Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network) which is proposed for intrusion detection along with the Ant Lion optimization algorithm. By this method, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is made hybrid with LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). Thus, all the attacks identified with the network layer of cloud are classified efficiently. The experimental results shown below describe the presentation of the IDS classification model with high accuracy, thus improving the detection rate or error rate. The optimized custom RC-NN-IDS model thus achieved an improved classification accuracy of 94% and also a decreased error rate of 0.0012. Additionally true positive rate, true negative rate and precision are considered as performance metrics. The proposed approach is evaluated using the DARPA IDS evaluation Data Sets and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset and is compared with some existing approaches.",
