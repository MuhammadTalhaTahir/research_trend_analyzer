    "title": "Buried objects detection in heterogeneous environment using UWB systems combined with curve fitting method",
    "abstract": "A new method is proposed to improve the accuracy of locating buried objects in heterogeneous environments using shifted time pulses with radio impulse  ultra wide band  (IR-UWB), time-hopping pulse position modulation (TH-BPSK UWB), binary  phase shift keying  (TH-BPSK UWB) systems combined with the  least square   curve fitting  method (LSCFM). The analytical expression is validated by simulation and the locating errors used to assess the performance of systems. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method has higher accuracy than the conventional ones.",
