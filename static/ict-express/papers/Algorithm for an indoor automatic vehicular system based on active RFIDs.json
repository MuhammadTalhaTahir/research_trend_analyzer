    "title": "Algorithm for an indoor automatic vehicular system based on active RFIDs",
    "abstract": "An algorithm for helping the routing of heavy vehicles within an industrial setting is proposed. The system makes use of active RFID tags placed all over the industrial area. The algorithm aims to minimize shifts and loads of heavy vehicles in order to reduce production times and costs. Results are encouraging and the system is particularly adaptable to different scenarios. For example, it could be used by companies producing concrete to drive trucks to efficiently collect the materials needed for the product recipe.",
