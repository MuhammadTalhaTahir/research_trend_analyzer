    "title": "Towards low-delay and high-throughput cognitive radio vehicular networks",
    "abstract": "Cognitive Radio Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (CR-VANETs) exploit cognitive radios to allow vehicles to access the unused channels in their radio environment. Thus, CR-VANETs do not only suffer the traditional CR problems, especially spectrum sensing, but also suffer new challenges due to the highly dynamic nature of VANETs. In this paper, we present a low-delay and high-throughput radio environment assessment scheme for CR-VANETs that can be easily incorporated with the IEEE 802.11p standard developed for VANETs. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the time to get the radio environment map and increases the CR-VANET throughput.",
