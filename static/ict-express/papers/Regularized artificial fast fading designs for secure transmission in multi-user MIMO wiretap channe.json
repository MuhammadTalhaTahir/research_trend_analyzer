    "title": "Regularized artificial fast fading designs for secure transmission in multi-user MIMO wiretap channels",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a regularized artificial fast fading (AFF) design for multi-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channels. To solve the effective channel gain reduction issue in conventional zero-forcing (ZF) based approaches, we propose a regularized AFF beamforming method by applying the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) problem and Lagrangian dual analysis. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed MMSE based AFF scheme improves the error performance of the legitimate user compared to the conventional ZF AFF method while achieving the same low probability of interception at the eavesdropper for multi-user MIMO secure transmission systems.",
