    "title": "Users emulation attack management in the massive internet of things enabled environment",
    "abstract": "Users’ emulation attacks are a prominent denial of service attack capable of degrading the entire performance of the network. In this paper, the detection and control of users’ emulation attacks in the massive internet of things networks were considered. An efficient power-based signal to interference ratio (SIR) approach was proposed to characterize the attackers’ behavior in the system. The trust list table was also adopted to further improve the detection of malicious nodes (MNs). The proposed approach shows an improved performance when compared with the conventional energy detection based approach which did not capture the channel interference in the system modeling. Through the received SIR, MNs can be identified owing to the higher transmission power required to disrupt the network.",
