    "title": "A hierarchical run-time adaptive resource allocation framework for large-scale MPSoC systems",
    "abstract": "In the embedded computer system domain, MPSoC systems have become increasingly popular due to the ever-increasing performance demands of modern embedded applications. The number of processing elements in these MPSoCs also steadily increases. Whereas current MPSoCs still contain a limited number of processing elements, future MPSoCs will feature tens up to hundreds of (heterogeneous) processing elements that are all integrated on a single chip. On these future large-scale MPSoC systems, the mapping of applications onto the hardware resources plays an important role to fully explore the parallelism of applications. In this article, a hierarchical run-time adaptive resource allocation framework which uses an intelligent task remapping approach is proposed to improve the system performance for large-scale MPSoCs.",
