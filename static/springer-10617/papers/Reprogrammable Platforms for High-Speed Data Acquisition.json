    "title": "Reprogrammable Platforms for High-Speed Data Acquisition",
    "abstract": "Complex embedded systems that do not target mass marketsoften have design and engineering costs that exceed production costs. Oneexample is the triggering and data acquisition system (DAQ) integrated intohigh-energy physics experiments. Parameterizable and reprogrammable architecturesare natural candidates as platforms for specialized embedded systems likehigh-speed data acquisition systems. In order to facilitate the design ofspecialized embedded systems, design strategies and tools are needed thatgreatly increase the efficiency of the design process. End-user programmabilityof reprogrammable platforms is essential, because system designers, withouttraining in low-level programming languages, are required to change the basedesign, compare designs, and generate configuration data for the reprogrammableplatforms. This paper presents a methodology for designing and evaluatinghigh-speed data acquisition systems using reprogrammable platforms.",
