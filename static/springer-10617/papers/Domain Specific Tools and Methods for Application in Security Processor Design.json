    "title": "Domain Specific Tools and Methods for Application in Security Processor Design",
    "abstract": "Security processors are used to implement cryptographic algorithmswith high throughput and/or low energy consumption constraints. The designof these processors is a balancing act between flexibility and energy consumption.The target is to create a processor with just enough programmability to covera set of algorithmsâ€”an application domain. This paper proposes GEZEL,a design environment consisting of a design language and an implementationmethodology that can be used for such domain specific processors. We use thesecurity domain as driver, and discuss the impact of the domain on the targetarchitecture. We also present a methodology to create, refine and verify asecurity processor.",
