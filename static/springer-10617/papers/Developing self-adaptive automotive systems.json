    "abstract": "Future Driving Assistance Systems (DAS) will have to react to changes within the system at runtime. This might be the case in Car-to-X systems where the availability of communication partners changes dynamically. Another example are systems like DAS for truck and trailer combinations where a trailer might be disconnected and replaced by another one several times a day. State-of-the-art DAS are not capable of handling these runtime changes. In our approach we make usage of the principles of Service-orientation to generate self-adaptive DAS on architectural level. But this technical approach requires the definition of a development process that fits into the practices within the automotive industry. This paper introduces SOMA4DDAS, a model-based development process based on the UML profile SoaML. SOMA4DDAS describes a tri-phase procedure to transfer an idea for a DAS into a detailed specification of the application and the Services involved. These phases are integrated into the “core process for system and software development” (CPSSD), a standard process within the automotive industry. The paper illustrates the benefits of this approach by developing a truck and trailer DAS consisting of 13 different Services.",
