    "title": "Scheduling for Concept-Oriented Rapid Prototyping",
    "abstract": "In this paper scheduling strategies for a rapid prototyping system are discussed. Our rapid prototyping system is able to deal with several CASE-tools and generate code for models of heterogenous domains. By using the emerging CASE Data Interchange Format CDIF the model data of CASE-tools is represented tool-independent. This tool-independent layer serves as a basis for analysis, simulation and code generation. The generated code is partitioned in tasks which must be scheduled as fast as possible using a real-time operating system to support high performance applications. We classify scheduling requirements for the constraints of rapid prototyping and present a new scheduling strategy called pseudo-rate scheduling which significantly improve the execution speed of rapid prototyping applications. Additionally, we provide a set of equations to estimate schedulability. Experimental results demonstrate the main advantages of our scheduling strategy.",
