    "title": "Model-driven software synthesis for hard real-time applications with energy constraints",
    "abstract": "Model-driven methods have been quite effective for reducing the intricacies of embedded software development, since they provide effective means for property verification as well as automatic code generation. Nevertheless, regarding energy-constrained hard real-time systems, few model-driven methods are available and, usually, most methods (model-driven or not) consider simplified system specifications, such as absence of intertask relations. This paper presents a model-driven method for software synthesis of hard real-time embedded applications with energy constraints. A formal model based on time Petri nets is adopted in order to provide a basis for pre-runtime schedule generation and property analysis/verification.",
