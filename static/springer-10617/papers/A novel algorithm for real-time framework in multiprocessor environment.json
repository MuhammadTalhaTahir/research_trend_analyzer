    "title": "A novel algorithm for real-time framework in multiprocessor environment",
    "abstract": "The objective of the paper is to represent the real-time framework in multiprocessor environment task scheduling process by examining the novel algorithm advanced PSO. The advanced PSO algorithm has the metaphor as the basis to facilitate social interaction, which makes a search on space by making adjustments to the trajectories of individual vectors, referred to “particles” as they are considered as the points that move within the multidimensional search space. This algorithm will reduce the turn-around time, burst time and waiting time for multiprocessor task scheduling, when compared to existing algorithm like first come first served algorithm, shortest job first algorithm and round robin scheduling algorithm. This proposed algorithm is developed and making hardware for tank level water control for single input single output tank system and two input two output tank system. LABVIEW software is used to implement the real-time algorithm in hardware and software. The time taken for searching best position for particles will be executed and compare with all algorithms using bar chart will be given in result.",
