    "title": "Efficient Block Scheduling to Minimize Context Switching Time for Programmable Embedded Processors",
    "abstract": "Scheduling is one of the most often addressed optimization problems in DSP compilation, behavioral synthesis, and system-level synthesis research. With the rapid pace of changes in modern DSP applications requirements and implementation technologies, however, new types of scheduling challenges arise. This paper is concerned with the problem of scheduling blocks of computations in order to optimize the efficiency of their execution on programmable embedded systems under a realistic timing model of their processors. We describe an effective scheme for scheduling the blocks of any computation on a given system architecture and with a specified algorithm implementing each block. We also present algorithmic techniques for performing optimal block scheduling simultaneously with optimal architecture and algorithm selection. Our techniques address the block scheduling problem for both single- and multiple-processor system platforms and for a variety of optimization objectives including throughput, cost, and power dissipation. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our techniques on numerous designs and synthetic examples.",
