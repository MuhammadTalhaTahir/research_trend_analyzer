    "title": "Video-based person re-identification by semi-supervised adaptive stepwise learning",
    "abstract": "Person re-identification (ReID) is mainly aimed at establishing correct identity correspondence among moving person collected by multiple cameras. Extending labeled data sets with pseudo-labels is one of the common methods of ReID. However, single evaluation standards and fixed screening pseudo-label methods make pseudo-labels gradually weaken their update rate. Based on that, we propose a semi-supervised adaptive stepwise learning (SSAS) method for accelerating the update of pseudo-labels. Using the concept of Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence, a more global pseudo-label update idea (GPLU) is proposed, an evaluation criterion of pseudo-labels is designed to satisfy two conditions: The first is to use simple tracklets as pseudo-label data in the early stage, and the second is to gradually add complex and diverse tracklets as pseudo-label data in the iterative process. Our proposed adaptive pseudo-label screening strategy steadily improves the recognition accuracy of ReID. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments on canonical data sets and the evaluation results suggest the superiority of our method.",
