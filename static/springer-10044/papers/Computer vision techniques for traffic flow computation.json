    "abstract": "This paper describes an application of computer vision techniques to road surveillance. It reports on a project undertaken in collaboration with the Research and Innovation group at the Ordnance Survey. The project aims to produce a system that detects and tracks vehicles in real traffic scenes to generate meaningful parameters for use in traffic management. The system has now been implemented using two different approaches: a feature-based approach that detects and groups corner features in a scene into potential vehicle objects, and an appearance-based approach that trains a cascade of classifiers to learn the appearances of vehicles as an arrangement of a set of pre-defined simple Haar features. Potential vehicles detected are then tracked through an image sequence, using the Kalman filter motion tracker. Experimental results of the algorithms are presented in this paper.",
