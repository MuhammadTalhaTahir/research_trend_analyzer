    "title": "An adaptive method for Chinese new word detection based on hypothesis testing",
    "abstract": "New word detection is a significant problem in Chinese information processing, which is also the basis of Chinese word segmentation, automatic translation and semantic analysis. To address the problem of new word detection, this paper first analyzes the features of Chinese new words, and then proposes a hypothesis-testing-based detection approach for Chinese new words. To simulate how people identify new words, three modules are included: the non-accidental testing is to identify strings that are obviously occurring in given texts, the correlation testing is to evaluate the internal correlation between adjacent characters, and common grammar rules are used for garbage string filtering after the testing. This hypothesis-testing-based detection approach avoids the subjective selection of thresholds of new words statistical features and can set thresholds adaptively according to general frequency information. Its implementation does not require large-scale corpus for training and can eliminate the influence of using different corpus on the recognition results. Comparison experimental results show that this method has good performance on both detection time and F-score.",
