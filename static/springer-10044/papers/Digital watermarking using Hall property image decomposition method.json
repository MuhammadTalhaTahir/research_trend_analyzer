    "title": "Digital watermarking using Hall property image decomposition method",
    "abstract": "Most of the existing singular value decomposition-based digital watermarking methods are not robust to geometric rotation, which change the pixels’ locations without maintaining the corresponding changes to the pixel’s intensity values of entire image and yield high computational cost. To answer this, we propose a digital image watermarking algorithm using the Hall property. In the proposed method, a digital watermark image is factorized into lower-triangular, upper-triangular, and permutation matrices. The permutation matrix is used as the valid key matrix for authentication of the rightful ownership of the watermark image. The product of the lower and upper triangular matrices is processed with a few iterations of the Arnold transformation to obtain the scrambled data. The scrambled data are embedded into particular sub-bands of a cover image using Wavelet transform. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm is highly reliable and computationally efficient compared with state-of-the-art methods that are based on singular value decomposition.",
