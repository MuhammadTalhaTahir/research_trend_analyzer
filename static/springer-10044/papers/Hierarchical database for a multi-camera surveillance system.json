    "title": "Hierarchical database for a multi-camera surveillance system",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for event detection and video content analysis for visual surveillance applications. The system is able to coordinate the tracking of objects between multiple camera views, which may be overlapping or non-overlapping. The key novelty of our approach is that we can automatically learn a semantic scene model for a surveillance region, and have defined data models to support the storage of tracking data with different layers of abstraction into a surveillance database. The surveillance database provides a mechanism to generate video content summaries of objects detected by the system across the entire surveillance region in terms of the semantic scene model. In addition, the surveillance database supports spatio-temporal queries, which can be applied for event detection and notification applications.",
