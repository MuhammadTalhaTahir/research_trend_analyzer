    "title": "A novel video saliency estimation method in the compressed domain",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel compressed domain saliency estimation method based on analyzing block motion vectors and transform residuals extracted from the bitstream of H.264/AVC compressed videos. Block motion vectors are analyzed by modeling their orientation values utilizing Dual Cross Patterns, a feature descriptor that earlier found applications in face recognition to obtain the motion saliency map. The transform residuals are analyzed by utilizing lifting wavelet transform on the luminance component of the macro-blocks to obtain the spatial saliency map. The motion saliency map and the spatial saliency map are fused utilizing the Dempster–Shafer combination rule to generate the final saliency map. It is shown through our experiments that Dual Cross Patterns and lifting wavelet transform features fused via Dempster–Shafer rule are superior in predicting fixations as compared to the existing state-of-the-art saliency models.",
