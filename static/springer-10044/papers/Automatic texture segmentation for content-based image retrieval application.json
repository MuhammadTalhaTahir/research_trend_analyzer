    "title": "Automatic texture segmentation for content-based image retrieval application",
    "abstract": "In this article, a brief review on texture segmentation is presented, before a novel automatic texture segmentation algorithm is developed. The algorithm is based on a modified discrete wavelet frames and the mean shift algorithm. The proposed technique is tested on a range of textured images including composite texture images, synthetic texture images, real scene images as well as our main source of images, the museum images of various kinds. An extension to the automatic texture segmentation, a texture identifier is also introduced for integration into a retrieval system, providing an excellent approach to content-based image retrieval using texture features.",
