    "title": "An efficient edge extraction approach for flame image analysis",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a simple and robust approach for flame and fire image analysis is proposed. It is based on the local binary patterns, double thresholding and Levenbergâ€“Marquardt optimization technique. The presented algorithm detects the sharp edges and removes the noise and irrelevant artifacts. The autoadaptive nature of the algorithm ensures the primary edges of the flame and fire are identified in the different conditions. Moreover, a graphical approach is presented which can be used to calculate the combustion furnace flame temperature. The various experimentations are carried out on synthetic as well as real flame and fire images which validate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach.",
