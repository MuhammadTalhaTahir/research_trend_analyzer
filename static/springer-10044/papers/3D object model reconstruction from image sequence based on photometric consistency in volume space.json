    "title": "3D object model reconstruction from image sequence based on photometric consistency in volume space",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a system that can reconstruct a photorealistic 3D object model from an image sequence captured at arbitrary viewpoints. The whole system consists of four steps: camera calibration, volumetric modeling, polygonal model formation and texture mapping. We adopt the shape-from-silhouette approach for volumetric modeling. There are two common types of object surface that are difficult to reconstructâ€”textureless surface and concave surface. To tackle the problems, we propose to perform the volumetric modeling based on the constraints of viewpoint proximity and photometric consistency in the volume space. The volumetric model is converted to the mesh model for efficient manipulation. Finally, the texture map is generated from the image sequence to give the 3D model a photorealistic appearance. Some reconstructed object models are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of our system as compared with the conventional modeling technique based on the photo-consistency in the image space.",
