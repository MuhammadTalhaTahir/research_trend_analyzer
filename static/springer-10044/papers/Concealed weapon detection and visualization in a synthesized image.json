    "title": "Concealed weapon detection and visualization in a synthesized image",
    "abstract": "Images acquired by heterogeneous image sensors may provide complementary information about the scene, for instance, the visual image can provide personal identification information like the facial pattern while the infrared (IR) or millimeter wave image can detect the suspicious regions of concealed weapons. Usually, a technique, namely multiresolution pixel-level image fusion is applied to integrate the information from multi-sensor images. However, when the images are significantly different, the performance of the multiresolution fusion algorithms is not always satisfactory. In this study, a new strategy consisting of two steps is proposed. The first step is to use an unsupervised fuzzy k-means clustering to detect the concealed weapon from the IR image. The detected region is embedded in the visual image in the second step and this process is implemented with a multiresolution mosaic technique. Therefore, the synthesized image retains the quality comparable to the visual image while the region of the concealed weapon is highlighted and enhanced. The experimental results indicate the efficiency of the proposed approach.",
