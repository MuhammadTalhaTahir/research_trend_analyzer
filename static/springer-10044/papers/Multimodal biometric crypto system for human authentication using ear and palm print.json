    "abstract": "The fuzzy vault structure, which is a biometric pattern safety process in which the biometric traits are represented as an unordered group, is an example of a biometric cryptosystem. A Hybrid Fuzzy Vault-Cuckoo Search algorithm is proposed in this article to provide the best recognition when compared to the existing approach. The module's methods include preprocessing, characteristic elimination, creating characteristic vectors, synthesis, and reformation. The proposed approach's performance is assessed using evaluation metrics.",
