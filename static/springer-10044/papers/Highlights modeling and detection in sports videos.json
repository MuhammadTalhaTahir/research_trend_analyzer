    "title": "Highlights modeling and detection in sports videos",
    "abstract": "Automatic annotation of semantic events allows effective retrieval of video content. In this work, we present solutions for highlights detection in sports videos. This application is particularly interesting for broadcasters, since they extensively use manual annotation to select interesting highlights that are edited to create new programmes. The proposed approach exploits the typical structure of a wide class of sports videos, namely, those related to sports which are played in delimited venues with playfields of well known geometry, like soccer, basketball, swimming, track and field disciplines, and so on. For this class of sports, a modeling scheme based on a limited set of visual cues and on finite state machines (FSM) that encode the temporal evolution of highlights is presented. Algorithms for model checking and for visual cues estimation are discussed, as well as applications of the representation to different sport domains.",
