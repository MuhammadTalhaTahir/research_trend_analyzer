    "abstract": "In this paper we compare two iterative approaches to the problem of pixel-level image restoration when the model contains unknown parameters. Pairwise interaction models are assumed to represent the local associations in the true scene. The first approach is a variation on the EM algorithm in which Mean-field approximations are used in the E-step and a variational approximation is used in the M-step. In the second approach, each iteration involves first restoring the image using the Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) algorithm and then updating the parameter estimates by maximising the so-called pseudolikelihood. In addition, refinemenrs are made to the Mean-field approximation, and these are also used for restoration. The methods are compared empirically using both artificial and real noise-corrupted binary scenes. Within the comparisons the effects of using different convergence criteria for deciding when to stop the algorithms are also investigated.",
