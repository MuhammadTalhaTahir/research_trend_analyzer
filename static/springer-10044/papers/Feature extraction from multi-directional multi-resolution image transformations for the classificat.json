    "title": "Feature extraction from multi-directional multi-resolution image transformations for the classification of zoom-endoscopy images",
    "abstract": "In this article, we discuss the discriminative power of a set of image features, extracted from detail subbands of the Gabor wavelet transform and the dual-tree complex wavelet transform for the purpose of computer-assisted zoom-endoscopy image classification. We incorporate color channel information into the classification process and show that this leads to superior classification results, compared to luminance-channel-only-based image analysis.",
