    "title": "Iterative feature refinement with network-driven prior for image restoration",
    "abstract": "Image restoration (IR) has been extensively studied with lots of excellent strategies accumulated over the years. However, most existing methods still have large room for improvement. In this paper, we boost an unsupervised iterative feature refinement model (IFR) with the enhanced high-dimensional deep mean-shift prior (EDMSP), termed IFR-EDMSP. The proposed model inherits the fantastic noise suppression characteristic of embedded network and the fine detail preservation ability of IFR model. Moreover, based on the fact that multiple implementations of artificial noise in prior learning improve underlying representation capability, three-sigma rule is adopted in IFR-EDMSP for accurate and robust results. Extensive experiments demonstrated that IFR-EDMSP outperforms the typical methods in compressed sensing, image deblurring and super-resolution.",
