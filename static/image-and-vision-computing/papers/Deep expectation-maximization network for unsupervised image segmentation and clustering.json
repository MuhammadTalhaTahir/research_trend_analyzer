    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning, such as unsupervised image segmentation and clustering, are fundamental tasks in image representation learning. In this paper, we design a deep expectation-maximization (DEM) network for unsupervised image segmentation and clustering. It is based on the statistical modeling of image in its latent feature space by Gaussian mixture model (GMM), implemented in a novel deep learning framework. Specifically, in the unsupervised setting, we design an auto-encoder network and an EM module over the image latent features, for jointly learning the image latent features and  GMM  model of the latent features in a single framework. To construct the EM-module, we unfold the iterative operations of  EM algorithm  and the online  EM algorithm  in fixed steps to be differentiable network blocks, plugged into the network to estimate the  GMM  parameters of the image latent features. The proposed network parameters can be end-to-end optimized using losses based on log-likelihood of GMM, entropy of Gaussian component assignment probabilities and image reconstruction error. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed networks achieve favorable results compared with several state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised image segmentation and clustering.",
