    "title": "Robust local features for remote face recognition",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a robust  local descriptor  for  face recognition . It consists of two components, one based on a shearlet-decomposition and the other on  local binary pattern  (LBP). Shearlets can completely analyze the singular structures of piecewise smooth images, which is useful since  singularities  and  irregular structures  carry useful information in an underlying image. Furthermore, LBP is effective for describing the edges extracted by shearlets even when the images contain high level of noise. Experimental results using the Face Recognition  Grand Challenge  dataset show that the proposed  local descriptor  significantly outperforms many widely used features (e.g., Gabor and deep learning-based features) when the images are corrupted by random noise, demonstrating robustness to noise. In addition, experimental results show promising results for two challenging datasets which have poor  image quality , i.e., a remote face dataset and the Point and Shoot Face Recognition Challenge dataset.",
