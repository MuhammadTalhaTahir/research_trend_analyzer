    "title": "Texture features for object salience",
    "abstract": "Although texture is important for many vision-related tasks, it is not used in most salience models. As a consequence, there are images where all existing salience algorithms fail. We introduce a novel set of  texture features  built on top of a fast model of complex cells in striate cortex, i.e., visual area V1. The texture at each position is characterised by the two-dimensional local  power spectrum  obtained from  Gabor filters  which are tuned to many scales and orientations. We then apply a  parametric model  and describe the local spectrum by the combination of two one-dimensional  Gaussian approximations : the scale and orientation distributions. The scale distribution indicates whether the texture has a dominant frequency and what frequency it is. Likewise, the orientation distribution attests the  degree of anisotropy . We evaluate the features in combination with the state-of-the-art VOCUS2 salience algorithm. We found that using our novel texture features in addition to colour improves AUC by 3.8% on the PASCAL-S dataset when compared to the colour-only baseline, and by 62% on a novel texture-based dataset.",
