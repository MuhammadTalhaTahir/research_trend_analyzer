    "title": "An MLP-based texture segmentation method without selecting a feature set",
    "abstract": "A texture segmentation technique which employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and does not consider the selection of features is presented in this paper. Thus, users can avoid selection and computation of the feature set and hence real-time segmentation may be possible. The technique apparently works in a fashion similar to our visual system whereby we do not consciously compute any feature for texture discrimination. A detailed study has been made for the selection of the network size. A newly proposed variant of the back-propagation algorithm has been used for more efficient training of the network. An edge-preserving noise-smoothing approach has been proposed to remove noise from the segmented image.",
