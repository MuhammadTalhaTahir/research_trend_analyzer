    "title": "Enhancing small object tracking with reversible rescaling networks",
    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving domain of  visual tracking , the accurate identification and tracking of small objects pose significant challenges due to their minimal pixel presence and detail deficiency. In the field of small object tracking, utilizing deep features derived from models trained on conventionally sized objects frequently leads to a substantial reduction in the fidelity of the representation. This discrepancy often undermines the effectiveness of tracking small objects. To address this challenge, we introduce the Reversible Small Object Tracker (RSTrack). RSTrack innovatively integrates two reversible  neural networks  into the tracking architecture, specifically tailored for the nuanced representation of small objects. Drawing upon the reversible networks' unique attribute of lossless information propagation, the reversible extraction network in RSTrack is adept at retaining a more  granular level  of detail pertaining to small objects. In addition, the reversible scaling network can suppress the background and highlight the small objects by enhancing the details of the image, effectively mitigating the issue of diminished object-background  discriminability  that arises from previously inadequate representational methods. Extensive experiments on four popular small object tracking benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves new state-of-the-art performances.",
