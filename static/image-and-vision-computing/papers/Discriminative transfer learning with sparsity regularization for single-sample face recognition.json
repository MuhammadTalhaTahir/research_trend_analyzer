    "title": "Discriminative transfer learning with sparsity regularization for single-sample face recognition",
    "abstract": "Discriminant analysis  is an important technique for  face recognition  because it can extract  discriminative features  to classify different persons. However, most existing discriminant analysis methods fail to work for single-sample face recognition (SSFR) because there is only a single  training sample  per person such that the within-class variation of this person cannot be estimated in such scenario. In this paper, we present a new discriminative  transfer learning  (DTL) approach for SSFR, where discriminant analysis is performed on a multiple-sample generic training set and then transferred into the single-sample gallery set. Specifically, our DTL learns a feature projection to minimize the intra-class variation and maximize the inter-class variation of samples in the training set, and minimize the difference between the generic training set and the gallery set, simultaneously. To make the DTL be robust to outliers and noise, we employ a  sparsity  regularizer to regularize the DTL and further propose a novel discriminative  transfer learning  with  sparsity  regularization (DTLSR) method. Experimental results on three face datasets including the FERET, CAS-PEAL-R1, and real-world LFW datasets are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed methods.",
