    "title": "Improved multi-source domain adaptation by preservation of factors",
    "abstract": "Domain Adaptation  (DA) is a highly relevant  research topic  when it comes to  image classification  with  deep neural networks . Combining multiple source domains in a sophisticated way to optimize a  classification model  can improve the generalization to a target domain. Here, the difference in data  distributions of source  and target image datasets plays a major role. In this paper, we describe based on a theory of visual factors how real-world scenes appear in images in general and how recent DA datasets are composed of such. We show that different domains can be described by a set of so called domain factors, whose values are consistent within a domain, but can change across domains. Many DA approaches try to remove all domain factors from the feature representation to be  domain invariant . In this paper we show that this can lead to negative transfer since task-informative factors can get lost as well. To address this, we propose Factor-Preserving DA (FP-DA), a method to train a deep adversarial  unsupervised DA  model, which is able to preserve specific task relevant factors in a multi-domain scenario. We demonstrate on CORe50 how such factors can be identified by standard one-to-one transfer experiments between single domains combined with  PCA . By applying FP-DA, we show that the highest average and minimum performance can be achieved. We also report improved performance for an adapted version of the OpenLORIS  object dataset .",
