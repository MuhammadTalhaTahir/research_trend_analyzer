    "title": "Image registration by local approximation methods",
    "abstract": "Image registration is approached as an approximation problem. Two locally sensitive transformation functions are proposed for image registration. These transformation functions are obtained by the weighted least-squares method and the local weighted mean method. The former is a global method and uses information about all control points to establish correspondence between local areas in the images; nearby control points are, however, given higher weights to make the process locally sensitive. The latter is a local method and uses information about local control points only to register local areas in the images.",
