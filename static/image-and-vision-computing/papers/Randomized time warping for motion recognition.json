    "title": "Randomized time warping for motion recognition",
    "abstract": "Dynamic time warping (DTW) has been widely used for the alignment and comparison of two sequential patterns. In DTW,  dynamic programming  is used to avoid an  exhaustive search  for the alignment. In this paper, we propose a randomized extension of the DTW concept, termed randomized time warping (RTW), for motion recognition. RTW generates time elastic (TE) features by randomly sampling the sequential data while retaining the temporal information. A set of TE features is represented by a low-dimensional subspace, called the sequence hypothesis (Hypo) subspace, and the similarity between two sequential patterns is defined by the canonical angles between the two corresponding Hypo subspaces. In essence, RTW simultaneously computes multiple degrees of similarities between a number of warped patterns' pair candidates, while in practice, RTW generalizes the Hankel matrix commonly used in modeling of  system dynamics . We demonstrate the applicability of RTW through experiments on  gesture recognition  using three public datasets, namely, the Cambridge gesture database, a subset of the one-shot-learning dataset from the ChaLearn Gesture Challenge, and the KTH action dataset.",
