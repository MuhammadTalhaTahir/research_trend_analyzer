    "title": "Learning weakly supervised audio-visual violence detection in hyperbolic space",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the task of weakly supervised audio-visual violence detection has gained considerable attention. The goal of this task is to identify violent segments within multimodal data based on video-level labels. Despite advances in this field, traditional Euclidean neural networks, which have been used in prior research, encounter difficulties in capturing highly discriminative representations due to limitations of the feature space. To overcome this, we propose  HyperVD , a novel framework that learns snippet embeddings in hyperbolic space to improve model discrimination. We contribute two branches of fully hyperbolic graph convolutional networks that excavate feature similarities and temporal relationships among snippets in hyperbolic space. By learning snippet representations in this space, the framework effectively learns semantic discrepancies between violent snippets and normal ones. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 85.67% AP, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a sizable margin.",
