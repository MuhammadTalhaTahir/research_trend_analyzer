    "title": "A Riemannian approach for free-space extraction and path planning using catadioptric omnidirectional vision",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a Riemannian approach for free-space extraction and  path planning  using color catadioptric vision. The problem is formulated considering color catadioptric images as  Riemannian manifolds  and solved using the Riemannian  Eikonal equation  with an  anisotropic  fast marching  numerical scheme . This formulation allows the integration of adapted color and spatial metrics in an incremental process. First, the traversable ground (namely  free-space ) is delimited using a color structure tensor built on the multi-dimensional components of the catadioptric image. Then, the  Eikonal equation  is solved in the image plane incorporating a generic  metric tensor  for central  catadioptric systems . This built Riemannian metric copes with the  geometric distortions  in the catadioptric image plane introduced by the curved mirror in order to compute the geodesic distance map and the shortest path between  image points . We present comparative results using Euclidean and  Riemannian distance  transforms and show the effectiveness of the Riemannian approach to produce safest path planning.",
