    "title": "Spatially aware feature selection and weighting for object retrieval",
    "abstract": "Many recent  image retrieval  methods are based on the “bag-of-words” (BoW) model with some additional spatial  consistency checking . This paper proposes a more accurate similarity measurement that takes into account  spatial layout  of visual words in an offline manner. The similarity measurement is embedded in the standard pipeline of the BoW model, and improves two features of the model:  i ) latent visual words are added to a query based on spatial co-occurrence, to improve query recall; and  ii ) weights of reliable visual words are increased to improve the precision. The combination of these methods leads to a more accurate measurement of image similarity. This is similar in concept to the combination of  query expansion  and spatial verification, but does not require  query time processing , which is too expensive to apply to full list of ranked results. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on three public datasets.",
