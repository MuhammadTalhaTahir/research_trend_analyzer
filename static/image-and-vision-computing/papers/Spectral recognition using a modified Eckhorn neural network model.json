    "title": "Spectral recognition using a modified Eckhorn neural network model",
    "abstract": "Studies of the visual cortex of the cat highlight the role of temporal processing using synchronous oscillations for object identification. In this paper, the original  neural network model  of Eckhorn has been modified according to the proposal of Johnson and others and used for spectral recognition. The method developed turns out to be a much simpler, faster and elegant way of spectral recognition than reported elsewhere.",
