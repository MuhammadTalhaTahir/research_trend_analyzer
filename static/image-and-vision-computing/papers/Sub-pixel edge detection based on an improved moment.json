    "title": "Sub-pixel edge detection based on an improved moment",
    "abstract": "A novel moment-based method for sub-pixel edge location is proposed. Based on coarse edge-location by SOBEL operator, the geometric information of the target is used to reduce the number of moment-template to only one, which can largely save the time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective with more robustness, higher precision and speed.",
