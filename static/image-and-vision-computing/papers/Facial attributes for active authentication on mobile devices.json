    "title": "Facial attributes for active authentication on mobile devices",
    "abstract": "We present a method using facial attributes for continuous  authentication  of smartphone users. We train a bunch of  binary attribute  classifiers which provide compact visual descriptions of faces. The learned classifiers are applied to the image of the current user of a mobile device to extract the attributes and then authentication is done by simply comparing the calculated attributes with the enrolled attributes of the original user. Extensive experiments on two publicly available unconstrained mobile face video datasets show that our method is able to capture meaningful attributes of faces and performs better than the previously proposed LBP-based  authentication method . We also provide a practical variant of our method for efficient continuous authentication on an actual mobile device by doing extensive platform evaluations of memory usage, power consumption, and authentication speed.",
