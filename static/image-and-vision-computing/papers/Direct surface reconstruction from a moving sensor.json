    "title": "Direct surface reconstruction from a moving sensor",
    "abstract": "A technique is described for surface reconstruction from a sequence of images when the sensor motion is known. The reconstruction takes the form of an orthographic depth map in a viewer-independent frame. Following a mathematical justification, the technique is illustrated with examples using noisy synthetic images.",
