    "abstract": "Accidental falls pose a significant public health challenge, especially among vulnerable populations. To address this issue, comprehensive research on fall detection and rescue systems is essential. Vision-based technologies, with their promising potential, offer an effective means to detect falls. This research paper presents a cutting-edge fall detection methodology aimed at enhancing individual safety and well-being. The proposed methodology utilizes  deep neural networks , leveraging their capabilities to drive advancements in fall detection. To overcome data limitations and computational efficiency concerns, this study employ  transfer learning  by fine-tuning pre-trained models on large-scale image datasets for fall detection. This approach significantly enhances model performance, enabling better generalization and accuracy, especially in real-time applications with constrained resources. Notably, the methodology achieved an impressive test accuracy of 98.15%. Additionally, the incorporation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques is used to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making in fall detection using  deep learning models , especially in critical healthcare contexts for vulnerable individuals. XAI provides valuable insights into complex model architectures and parameters, enabling a  deeper understanding  of fall  identification patterns . To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous experimentation was conducted using a diverse dataset containing real-world fall and non-fall scenarios. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in both accuracy and  interpretability , confirming the superiority of this method over conventional fall detection approaches.",
