    "title": "A survey on freehand sketch recognition and retrieval",
    "abstract": "With the development of digital devices and pressure sensing equipment, research into freehand sketches from touch-screen interfaces has increased significantly in recent years. As such, we provide the first comprehensive survey of recognition tasks based on sketch generation, freehand sketch classification, sketch-based  image retrieval  (SBIR), fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR), and sketch-based 3D shape image retrieval. Specifically, SBIR and FG-SBIR were the main focus of the survey. Primary technologies and benchmark datasets related to all sketch-based recognition topics are also discussed, along with future trends for this promising technology.",
