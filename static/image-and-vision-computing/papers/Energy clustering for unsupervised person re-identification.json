    "title": "Energy clustering for unsupervised person re-identification",
    "abstract": "Due to the high cost of data annotation in supervised person re-identification (re-ID) methods,  unsupervised methods  become more attractive in the real world. Recently, the  hierarchical clustering  serves as a promising unsupervised method. One key factor of  hierarchical clustering  is the distance measurement strategy. Ideally, a good distance measurement should consider both inter-cluster and intra-cluster distance of all samples. To solve this problem, we propose to use the  energy distance  to measure inter-cluster distance in hierarchical clustering (E-cluster), and use the sum of squares of deviations (SSD) as a  regularization term  to measure intra-cluster distance for further performance promotion. We evaluate our method on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID. Extensive experiments show that E-cluster obtains significant improvements over the state-of-the-arts fully unsupervised methods.",
