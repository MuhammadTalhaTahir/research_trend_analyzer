    "title": "Towards a low bandwidth talking face using appearance models",
    "abstract": "This paper is motivated by the need to develop low bandwidth virtual humans capable of delivering audio-visual speech and sign language at a quality comparable to high bandwidth video. Using an appearance model combined with parameter compression significantly reduces the number of bits required for animating the face of a virtual human. A perceptual method is used to evaluate the quality of the synthesised sequences and it appears that 3.6 kb s âˆ’1  can yield acceptable quality.",
