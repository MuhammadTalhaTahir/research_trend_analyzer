    "title": "Spline-based recognition of straight lines and curves in engineering line drawings",
    "abstract": "The paper addresses the problem of distinguishing straight lines from curves in noisy grey tone images and representing those lines and curves mathematically. A method for locating corners is discussed, and a technique based on spline representations is proposed for classifying line segments as straight or curved. Results are given for several typical noisy engineering line drawings.",
