    "title": "Eye detection using discriminatory Haar features and a new efficient SVM",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an accurate and efficient eye detection method using the discriminatory Haar features (DHFs) and a new efficient  support vector machine  (eSVM). The DHFs are extracted by applying a discriminating feature extraction (DFE) method to the 2D Haar  wavelet transform . The DFE method is capable of extracting multiple discriminatory features for two-class problems based on two novel measure vectors and a new criterion in the whitened  principal component  analysis (PCA) space. The eSVM significantly improves the computational efficiency upon the conventional SVM for eye detection without sacrificing the  generalization performance . Experiments on the  Face Recognition   Grand Challenge  (FRGC) database and the BioID face database show that (i) the DHFs exhibit promising classification capability for eye detection problem; (ii) the eSVM runs much faster than the conventional SVM; and (iii) the proposed eye detection method achieves near real-time eye detection speed and better eye detection performance than some state-of-the-art eye detection methods.",
