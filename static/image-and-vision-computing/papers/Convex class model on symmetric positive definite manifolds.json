    "title": "Convex class model on symmetric positive definite manifolds",
    "abstract": "The effectiveness of Symmetric  Positive Definite  (SPD) manifold features has been proven in various  computer vision tasks . However, due to the non-Euclidean geometry of these features, existing Euclidean machineries cannot be directly used. In this paper, we tackle the  classification tasks  with limited  training data  on SPD manifolds. Our proposed framework, named Manifold Convex Class Model, represents each class on SPD manifolds using a  convex model , and classification can be performed by computing distances to the convex models. We provide three methods based on different metrics to address the  optimization problem  of the smallest distance of a point to the convex model on SPD manifold. The efficacy of our proposed framework is demonstrated both on  synthetic data  and several  computer vision  tasks including object recognition,  texture classification , person re-identification and traffic scene classification.",
