    "title": "Hierarchical disentangled representation for image denoising and beyond",
    "abstract": "Image denoising is a typical ill-posed problem due to complex degradation. Leading methods based on normalizing flows have tried to solve this problem with an invertible transformation instead of a deterministic mapping. However, it is difficult to construct feasible bijective mapping to remove spatial-variant noise while recovering fine texture and structure details due to latent ambiguity in  inverse problems . Inspired by a common observation that noise tends to appear in the high-frequency part of the image, we propose a fully invertible denoising method that injects the idea of disentangled learning into a general invertible architecture to split noise from the high-frequency part. More specifically, we decompose the  noisy image  into clean low-frequency and hybrid high-frequency parts with an invertible transformation and then disentangle case-specific noise and high-frequency components in the latent space. In this way, denoising is made tractable by inversely merging noiseless low and high-frequency parts. Furthermore, we construct a flexible hierarchical disentangling framework, which aims to decompose most of the low-frequency image information while disentangling noise from the high-frequency part in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on real image denoising, JPEG compressed artifact removal, and medical low-dose CT image restoration have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on both quantitative metrics and visual quality, with significantly less computational cost.",
