    "title": "Bottom-up unsupervised image segmentation using FC-Dense u-net based deep representation clustering and multidimensional feature fusion based region merging",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in system resources provide ease in the applicability of  deep learning  approaches in  computer vision . In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based unsupervised image  segmentation approach  for natural  image segmentation . Image segmentation aims to transform an image into regions, representing various objects in the image. Our method consists of a fully convolutional dense network-based unsupervised deep representation oriented clustering, followed by shallow features based high-dimensional region merging to produce the final  segmented image . We evaluate our proposed approach on the BSD300 database and perform a comparison with several classical and some recent deep learning-based unsupervised  segmentation methods . The experimental results represent that the proposed method is comparable and confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach.",
