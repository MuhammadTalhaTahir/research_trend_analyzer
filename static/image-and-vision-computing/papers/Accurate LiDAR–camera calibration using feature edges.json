    "title": "Accurate LiDAR–camera calibration using feature edges",
    "abstract": "Accurate extrinsic calibration is essential for minimizing alignment errors between LiDAR and cameras, ensuring precise sensor data registration, and enhancing the robustness and accuracy of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. Although previous calibration techniques employing plane and point features, as well as neural networks, have shown promise, they are not devoid of limitations. Particularly, prominent point features such as chessboard corners may lack precise counterparts in the sparse point clouds generated by LiDAR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel LiDAR–camera extrinsic calibration method that leverages edge registration with known correspondences. This approach significantly reduces calibration discrepancies associated with imprecise correspondences and systemic noise, providing a systematic and rigorous framework to improve the precision of extrinsic calibration between LiDAR and camera systems. Additionally, the flexibility of our method allows for the use of common everyday objects, such as boxes, books, or sheets of paper, for calibration purposes, simplifying the procedure and enhancing its practical applicability.",
