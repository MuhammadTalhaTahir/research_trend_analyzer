    "title": "A neural implementation of the Hough transform and the advantages of explaining away",
    "abstract": "The  Hough transform  (HT) is widely used for feature extraction and object detection. However, during the HT individual image elements vote for many possible parameter values. This results in a dense accumulator array and problems identifying the parameter values that correspond to  image features . This article proposes a new method for implementing the voting process in the HT. This method employs a competitive  neural network algorithm  to perform a form of  probabilistic inference  known as “explaining away”. This results in a sparse accumulator array in which the parameter values of image features can be more accurately identified. The proposed method is initially demonstrated using the simple, prototypical, task of  straight line  detection in  synthetic images . In this task it is shown to more accurately identify straight lines, and the parameter of those lines, compared to the standard Hough voting process. The proposed method is further assessed using a version of the implicit shape model (ISM) algorithm applied to car detection in natural images. In this application it is shown to more accurately identify cars, compared to using the standard Hough voting process in the same algorithm, and compared to the original ISM algorithm.",
