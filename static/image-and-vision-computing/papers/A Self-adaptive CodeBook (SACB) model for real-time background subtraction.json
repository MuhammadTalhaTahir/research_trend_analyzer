    "title": "A Self-adaptive CodeBook (SACB) model for real-time background subtraction",
    "abstract": "Effective and efficient  background subtraction  is important to a number of  computer vision tasks . In this paper, we introduce a new background model that integrates several new techniques to address key challenges for  background modeling  for  moving object detection  in videos. The novel features of our proposed Self-adaptive CodeBook (SACB) background model are: a more effective color model using YCbCr color space, a statistical parameter estimation method, and a new algorithm for adding new background codewords into the permanent model and deleting noisy codewords from the models. Also, a new block-based approach is introduced to exploit the local spatial information. The proposed model is rigorously tested and has shown significant  performance improvements  over several previous models.",
