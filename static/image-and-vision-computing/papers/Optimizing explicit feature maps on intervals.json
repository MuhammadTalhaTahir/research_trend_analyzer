    "title": "Optimizing explicit feature maps on intervals",
    "abstract": "Approximating non-linear kernels by finite-dimensional feature maps is a popular approach for accelerating training and evaluation of  support vector machines  or to encode information into efficient match kernels. We propose a novel method of data independent construction of low-dimensional feature maps. The problem is formulated as a  linear program  that jointly considers two competing objectives: the quality of the approximation and the dimensionality of the feature map. For both shift-invariant and homogeneous kernels the proposed method achieves better approximation at the same dimensionality or comparable approximations at lower dimensionality of the feature map compared with state-of-the-art methods.",
