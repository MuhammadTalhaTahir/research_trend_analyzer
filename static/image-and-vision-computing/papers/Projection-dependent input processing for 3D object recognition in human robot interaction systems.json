    "title": "Projection-dependent input processing for 3D object recognition in human robot interaction systems",
    "abstract": "Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) provides assisted services in different real-time applications. The  robotic systems  identify objects through digital visualization wherein a three-dimensional (3D) image is converged to a plane-based projection. The projection is analyzed using the co-ordinates and identification points for recognizing the object. In such a converging process, the misidentification of projections in different planes results in recognition errors. This article proposes projection-dependent input processing (PDIP) method to reduce the misidentifications in object recognition. In this method, the input is the visualizing image projected in all the possible dimensions to identify the conjoining indices. The conjoined indices without intersection are segregated using labeled analysis. The non-correlating indices are identified in the possible dimension projections to prevent errors. The deviations in planes and indices matching are prevented by correlating the input with similar stored inputs with labels. The proposed method is verified using the metrics recognition ratio (96.4%), time (630.36Â ms), complexity (5.93), and error (0.605).",
