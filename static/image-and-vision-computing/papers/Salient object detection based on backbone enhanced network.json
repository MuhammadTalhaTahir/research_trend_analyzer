    "title": "Salient object detection based on backbone enhanced network",
    "abstract": "The  Convolutional Neural Networks  (CNNs) with encoder-decoder architecture has shown powerful ability in  semantic segmentation  and it has also been applied in  saliency detection . In most researches, the parameters of the  backbone network  which have been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset will be retrained using the new training dataset to let CNNs adapt to the new task better. But the retraining will weaken generalization of the pre-trained backbone network and result in over-fitting, especially when the scale of the new  training data  is not very large. To make a balance between generalization and precision, and to further improve the performance of the CNNs with encoder-decoder architecture in  salient object detection , we proposed a framework with enhanced backbone network (BENet). A encoder with structure of dual backbone networks (DBNs) is adopted in BENet to extract more diverse feature maps. In addition, BENet includes a connection module based on improved Res2Net to efficiently fuse feature maps from the two backbone networks and a decoder based on weighted multi-scale feedback module (WMFM) to perform synchronous learning. Our approach is extensively evaluated on six public datasets, and experimental results show significant and consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods without any additional supervision.",
