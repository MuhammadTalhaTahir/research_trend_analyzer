    "title": "Multiple human tracking in high-density crowds",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a fully automatic algorithm to detect and track multiple humans in high-density crowds in the presence of extreme occlusion. Typical approaches such as  background modeling  and body part-based pedestrian detection fail when most of the scene is in motion and most body parts of most of the pedestrians are occluded. To overcome this problem, we integrate human detection and tracking into a single framework and introduce a confirmation-by-classification method for tracking that associates detections with tracks, tracks humans through occlusions, and eliminates  false positive  tracks. We use a Viola and Jones  AdaBoost  detection cascade, a particle filter for tracking, and  color histograms  for appearance modeling. To further reduce false detections due to dense features and shadows, we introduce a method for estimation and utilization of a 3D head plane that reduces false positives while preserving high detection rates. The algorithm learns the head plane from observations of human heads incrementally, without any a priori extrinsic  camera calibration  information, and only begins to utilize the head plane once confidence in the parameter estimates is sufficiently high. In an experimental evaluation, we show that confirmation-by-classification and head plane estimation together enable the construction of an excellent pedestrian tracker for dense crowds.",
