    "title": "Few-shot object detection via baby learning",
    "abstract": "Few-shot learning is proposed to overcome the problem of scarce  training data  in novel classes. Recently, few-shot learning has been well adopted in various  computer vision tasks  such as object recognition and object detection. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have less attention to effectively reuse the information from previous stages. In this paper, we propose a new framework of few-shot learning for object detection. In particular, we adopt Baby Learning mechanism along with the multiple receptive fields to effectively utilize the former knowledge in novel domain. The propoed framework imitates the learning process of a baby through visual cues. The extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the SOTA methods on the benchmarks (improve average 7.0% on PASCAL VOC and 1.6% on MS COCO).",
