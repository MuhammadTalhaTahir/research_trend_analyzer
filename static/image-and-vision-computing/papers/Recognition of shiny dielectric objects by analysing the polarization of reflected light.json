    "title": "Recognition of shiny dielectric objects by analysing the polarization of reflected light",
    "abstract": "The degree of polarization of light reflected from a transparent or translucent object depends only upon the angle of incidence, refractive index and absorption coefficient of the material. It is therefore possible to determine the orientation of the surface normal from the direction of the plane of polarization. The feasibility of this is demonstrated both theoretically and practically by calculating and measuring the reflectance map of a sphere when viewed through a plane polarizing filter. Ambiguities in the mapping from radiance to orientation are removed by orienting the filter at three angles. The orientation of our objects is determined to within an uncertainty of less than seven degrees.",
