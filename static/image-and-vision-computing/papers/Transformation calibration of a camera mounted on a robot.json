    "title": "Transformation calibration of a camera mounted on a robot",
    "abstract": "The paper describes the accurate calibration of the camera transformation for a vision system consisting of a camera mounted on a robot. The calibration includes an analysis of the linearity of the camera. A knowledge of the camera transformation allows the three-dimensional position of the object points to be determined using triangulation.",
