    "title": "A new wavelet-based fuzzy single and multi-channel image denoising",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new wavelet shrinkage algorithm based on fuzzy logic. In particular, intra-scale dependency within  wavelet coefficients  is modeled using a fuzzy feature. This  feature space  distinguishes between important coefficients, which belong to image discontinuity and noisy coefficients. We use this fuzzy feature for enhancing wavelet coefficients' information in the shrinkage step. Then a  fuzzy membership function  shrinks wavelet coefficients based on the fuzzy feature. In addition, we extend our  noise reduction algorithm  for multi-channel images. We use inter-relation between different channels as a fuzzy feature for improving the  denoising  performance compared to denoising each channel, separately. We examine our  image denoising  algorithm in the dual-tree discrete  wavelet transform , which is the new shiftable and modified version of discrete  wavelet transform . Extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art image denoising algorithm indicate that our image denoising algorithm has a better performance in  noise suppression  and  edge preservation .",
