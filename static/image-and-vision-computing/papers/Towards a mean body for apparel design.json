    "title": "Towards a mean body for apparel design",
    "abstract": "This paper focuses on shape average with applications to the apparel industry. Apparel industry uses a consensus  sizing system ; its major concern is to fit most of the population into it. Since anthropometric measures do not grow linearly, it is important to find prototypes to accurately represent each size. This is done using random compact mean sets, obtained from a cloud of 3D points given by a scanner and applying to the sample a previous definition of mean set. Additionally, two approaches to define confidence sets are introduced. The methodology is applied to data obtained from a real  anthropometric survey .",
