    "title": "A novel iris weight map method for less constrained iris recognition based on bit stability and discriminability",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel iris weight map method for iris matching stage to improve less constrained  iris recognition . The proposed iris weight map considers both intra-class bit stability and inter-class bit  discriminability  of iris codes. We model the intra-class bit stability in a stability map to improve the intra-class matching. The stability map assigns more weight to the bits that have values more consistent with their noiseless and stable estimates obtained using a low rank approximation from a set of noisy training images. Also, we express the inter-class bit discriminability in a discriminability map to enhance the inter-class separation. We calculate the discriminability map using a 1-to-N strategy, emphasizing the bits with more  discriminative power  in iris codes. The final iris weight map is the combination of the stability map and the discriminability map. We conduct experimental analysis on four publicly available datasets captured in varying less constrained conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed iris weight map achieves generally improved identification and verification performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
