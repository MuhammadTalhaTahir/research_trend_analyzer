    "title": "A spatial-frequency domain multi-branch decoder method for real-time semantic segmentation",
    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is crucial for the functionality of autonomous driving systems. However, most of the existing real-time semantic segmentation models focus on encoder design and underutilize spatial and frequency domain information in the decoder, limiting the segmentation accuracy of the model. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a multi-branch decoder network combining spatial domain and frequency domain to meet the real-time and accuracy requirements of the semantic segmentation task of road scenes for autonomous driving systems. Firstly, the network introduces a novel multi-scale dilated fusion block that gradually enlarges the receptive field through three consecutive dilated convolutions, and integrates features from different levels using skip connections. At the same time, a strategy of gradually reducing the number of channels is adopted to effectively remove redundant features. Secondly, we design three branches for the decoder. The global branch utilizes a lightweight Transformer architecture to extract global features and employs horizontal and vertical convolutions to achieve interaction among global features. The multi-scale branch combines dilated convolution and adaptive pooling to perform multi-scale feature extraction through fusion and post-processing. The wavelet transform feature converter maps spatial domain features into low-frequency and high-frequency components, which are then fused with global and multi-scale features to enhance the model representation. Finally, we conduct experiments on multiple datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method best balances segmentation accuracy and inference speed.",
