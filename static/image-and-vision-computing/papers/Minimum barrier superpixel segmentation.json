    "title": "Minimum barrier superpixel segmentation",
    "abstract": "Superpixel  has become an essential processing unit in many  computer vision  systems, and  superpixel segmentation  of images is one of the most important step. In this paper, an efficient superpixel  segmentation algorithm  was proposed. We introduce a new compact-aware minimum barrier distance for superpixel segmentation (MBS), and a propagation scheme for the cluster centers between adjacent levels on a hierarchical architecture. Experiments show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be configured with simple trade-off between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, the compactness of segmented superpixel could be flexibly controlled continuously by only one parameter, which could be easily integrated in other  computer vision tasks . The  source code  of MBS is available at  https://github.com/YinlinHu/MBS .",
