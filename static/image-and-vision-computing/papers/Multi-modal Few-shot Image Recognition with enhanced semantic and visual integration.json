    "title": "Multi-modal Few-shot Image Recognition with enhanced semantic and visual integration",
    "abstract": "Few-Shot Learning (FSL) enables models to recognize new classes with only a few examples by leveraging knowledge from known classes. Although some methods incorporate class names as prior knowledge, effectively integrating visual and semantic information remains challenging. Additionally, conventional similarity measurement techniques often result in information loss, obscure distinctions between samples, and fail to capture intra-sample diversity. To address these issues, this paper presents a Multi-modal Few-shot Image Recognition (MFSIR) approach. We first introduce the Multi-Scale Interaction Module (MSIM), which facilitates multi-scale interactions between semantic and visual features, significantly enhancing the representation of visual features. We also propose the Hybrid Similarity Measurement Module (HSMM), which integrates information from multiple dimensions to evaluate the similarity between samples by dynamically adjusting the weights of various similarity measurement methods, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of similarity assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods on four FSL benchmarks, with marked improvements in FSL accuracy under 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios.",
