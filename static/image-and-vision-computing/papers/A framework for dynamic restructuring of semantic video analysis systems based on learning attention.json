    "title": "A framework for dynamic restructuring of semantic video analysis systems based on learning attention control",
    "abstract": "Current semantic video analysis systems are usually hierarchical and consist of some levels to overcome  semantic gaps  between low-level features and high-level concepts. In these systems, some features, descriptors, objects or concepts are extracted in each level and therefore, total  computational complexity  of such systems is huge. In this paper, we present a new general framework to impose attention control on a video analysis system using Q-learning. Thus, our proposed framework restructures a given system dynamically to direct attention to the blocks extracting the most informative features/concepts and reduces computational complexity of the system. In other words, the proposed framework directs flow of processing actively using a learning attention  control method . The proposed framework is evaluated for  event detection  in broadcast soccer videos using limited numbers of  training samples . Experiments show that the proposed framework is able to learn how to direct attention to informative features/concepts and restructure the initial structure of the system dynamically to reach the final goal with less computational complexity.",
