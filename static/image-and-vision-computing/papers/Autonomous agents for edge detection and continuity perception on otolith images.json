    "title": "Autonomous agents for edge detection and continuity perception on otolith images",
    "abstract": "An automatic method for edge detection on biological images (otolith images) using a multi-agent system is presented. One of the major problems encountered during an automatic contour detection is the lack of structure continuity perception. In this paper we present a new approach to perceive continuity based on a 2D reconstruction of  closed contours  using a multi-agent system. Each agent is provided with sensors on the image, which allow it to follow local intensity extremes. The purpose is to detect alternative light and dark concentric structures in an image. To improve the detection of these reactive agents, we have added high-level information about the shape of the contour. An application to fish  otolith   growth ring  detection is presented in this paper.",
