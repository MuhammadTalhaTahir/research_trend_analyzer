    "title": "Interaction framework for home environment using speech and vision",
    "abstract": "In this article we describe an  interaction framework  that uses speech recognition and computer-vision to model new generation of interfaces in the residential environment. We outline the blueprints of the architecture and describe the main  building blocks . We show a concrete prototype platform where this novel architecture has been deployed and tested at the user field trials. The work is co-funded by EC as part of “HomeTalk” IST-2001-33507 project.",
