    "title": "Structured deep Fisher pruning for efficient facial trait classification",
    "abstract": "High efficiency is desirable for many interactive  biometrics  tasks, including facial trait recognition. Although deep convolutional nets are effective for a multitude of  classification tasks , their high space and time demands make them impractical for PCs and mobile devices without a powerful  GPU . In this paper, we propose a structured filter-level pruning approach based on Fisher LDA [ 1 ], which boosts efficiency while maintaining accuracy for facial trait classification. It starts from the last  convolutional layer  where we find filter activations are less correlated. Through Fisher's LDA, we show that this  decorrelation  makes it safe to discard directly filters with high within-class variance and low between-class variance. The pruning goes on by tracing  deconvolution  based dependency over layers. Combined with light classifiers, the reduced  CNNs  can achieve comparable accuracies on example facial traits from the LFWA(+) and CelebA datasets, but with large reductions in model size (96%â€“98% for VGG-16, 81% for GoogLeNet) and computation (as high as 80% for VGG-16, 61% for GoogLeNet).",
