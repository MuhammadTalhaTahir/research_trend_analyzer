    "title": "An adaptive potential for robust shape estimation",
    "abstract": "This paper describes an algorithm for shape estimation in cluttered scenes. A new image potential is defined based on strokes detected in the image. The motivation is simple. Feature detectors (e.g. edge points detectors) produce many outliers, which hamper the performance of boundary extraction algorithms. To overcome this difficulty we organize edges in strokes and assign a confidence degree (weight) to each stroke. The confidence degrees depend on the distance of the stroke points to the boundary estimates and they are updated during the estimation process. A  deformable model  is used to estimate the object boundary, based on the minimization of an adaptive potential function which depends on the confidence degree assigned to each stroke. Therefore, the image potential changes during the estimation process. Both steps (weight update, energy minimization) are derived as the solution of a  maximum likelihood estimation  problem using the  EM algorithm . Experimental tests are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.",
