    "title": "Certifiable relative pose estimation",
    "abstract": "In this paper we present the first fast  optimality  certifier for the non-minimal version of the Relative Pose problem for calibrated cameras from  epipolar constraints . The proposed certifier is based on  Lagrangian  duality and relies on a novel closed-form expression for dual points. We also leverage an efficient solver that performs  local optimization  on the manifold of the original problem's non-convex  domain . The  optimality  of the solution is then checked  via  our novel fast certifier. The extensive conducted experiments demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, this certifiable solver performs excellently on  synthetic data , repeatedly attaining the (certified  a  posteriori ) optimal solution and shows a satisfactory performance on  real data .",
