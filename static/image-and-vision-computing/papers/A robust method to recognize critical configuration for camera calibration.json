    "title": "A robust method to recognize critical configuration for camera calibration",
    "abstract": "When space points and camera optical center lie on a twisted cubic, no matter how many pairs there are used from the space points to their  image points , camera parameters cannot be determined uniquely. This configuration is critical for  camera calibration . We set up  invariant relationship  between six space points and their image points for the  critical configuration . Then based on the relationship, an algorithm to recognize the critical configuration of at least six pairs of space and image points is proposed by using a constructed criterion function, where no any explicit computation on camera projective matrix or optical center is needed. Experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method.",
