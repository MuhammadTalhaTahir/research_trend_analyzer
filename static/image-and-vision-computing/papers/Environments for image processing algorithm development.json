    "title": "Environments for image processing algorithm development",
    "abstract": "The development of image processing algorithms can be greatly assisted by a software environment which is suitable for rapidly implementing and testing new ideas. This paper looks at a traditional approach to providing such an environment and highlights its weaknesses. The requirements of an ideal system are summarized and some observations are made about alternative software approaches.",
