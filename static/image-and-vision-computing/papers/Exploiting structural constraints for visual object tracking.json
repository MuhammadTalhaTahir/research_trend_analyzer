    "title": "Exploiting structural constraints for visual object tracking",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel structure-aware method for  visual tracking . The proposed tracker relies on  keypoint  regions as salient and stable elements that encode the object structure efficiently. In addition to the object  structural properties , the appearance model also includes global  color features  that we first use in a  probabilistic approach  to reduce the  search space . The second step of our tracking procedure is based on keypoint matching to provide a preliminary prediction of the target state. Final prediction is then achieved by exploiting object structural constraints, where target keypoints vote for the corrected object location. Once the object location is obtained, we update the appearance model and  structural properties , allowing  tracking targets  with changing appearance and non-rigid structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Structure-Aware Tracker (SAT) outperforms recent state-of-the-art trackers in challenging scenarios, especially when the target is partly occluded and in moderately crowded scenes.",
