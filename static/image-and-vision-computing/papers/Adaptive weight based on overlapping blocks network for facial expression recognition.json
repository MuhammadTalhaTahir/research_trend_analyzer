    "title": "Adaptive weight based on overlapping blocks network for facial expression recognition",
    "abstract": "Facial expressions which contain rich behavioral information are the primary vehicle to express emotions. It is important to analyze people's emotions with computer to achieve human-computer interaction. Feature extraction is the most important factor affecting the recognition effect. However, the existing  deep learning  for expression recognition is mainly based on global feature extraction.  Local feature  extraction provides more fine-grained information than global features. To strengthen the local discrimination of the image and pay more attention to the small targets in the local region, we propose an innovative Adaptive Weight Based on Overlapping Blocks Network (AWOBNet) for  learning feature  representation. First, we spatially overlay the feature maps to obtain the local features of the  face . Considering the correlation and proportion between different features, we model the correlation between feature channels after overlapping blocks. Moreover, a new adaptive weighting method is developed to enhance significant features. We evaluate the proposed network on two public datasets, including the Real-World Affective Faces Database (RAFDB) and the Static Facial Expressions in the Wild (SFEW), and show the performance using the  visualization method . The accuracy rates of our method obtain 89.863% on RAFDB and 62.410% on SFEW, which is significantly higher than the existing technical level.",
