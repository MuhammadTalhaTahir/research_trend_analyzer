    "title": "Enhancing single-view 3D mesh reconstruction with the aid of implicit surface learning",
    "abstract": "The open and ill-posed problem of single-view 3D object reconstruction has been tackled using different approaches with varying degrees of success. Previous approaches are constrained in the quality of their outputs to the in-network shape representation used. This work proposes to enhance the output of a mesh-based single-view object reconstruction model with the aid of additional implicit surface learning. Specifically, it proposes a two-branch network that learns both explicit and implicit representations in an end-to-end fashion. The explicit branch learns to deform a template spherical mesh and the implicit branch learns to regress to the real signed distance values of an implicit surface function. Practically, the mesh output of the proposed hybrid method is enhanced through a surface matching loss by which it is ensured that the mesh output aligns with the zero-isosurface of the learned implicit function. Experiments show that this hybrid approach results in meshes with a lower surface-to-surface error when compared to meshes produced from the explicit branch alone. The proposed hybrid method also outperforms the state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction methods using different evaluation metrics and compares favorably to prior work incorporating a hybrid approach. It also generalizes well to real-world images despite being trained with synthetic images.",
