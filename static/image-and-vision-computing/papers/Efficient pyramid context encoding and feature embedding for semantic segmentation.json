    "title": "Efficient pyramid context encoding and feature embedding for semantic segmentation",
    "abstract": "For reality applications of  semantic segmentation , inference speed and memory usage are two important factors. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight feature pyramid encoding network (FPENet) for semantic segmentation with a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. We use a series of feature pyramid encoding (FPE) blocks to encode context at multiple scales in the encoder. Each FPE block consists of different depthwise dilated convolutions that perform as a spatial pyramid to extract features and reduce computational costs. During training, a one-shot  neural architecture search  algorithm is adopted to find the optimal structure for each FPE block from a large  search space  with a small search cost. After the search for the encoder, a mutual embedding upsample module is introduced in the decoder, consisting of two attention blocks. The encoder-decoder  attention mechanism  is used to help aggregate efficiently high-level  semantic features  and low-level  spatial details . The proposed network outperforms the existing real-time methods with fewer parameters and improved inference speed on the Cityscapes and CamVid benchmark datasets. Specifically, it achieved 72.3% mean IoU on the Cityscapes test set with only 0.4 M parameters and 192.6 FPS speed on an Nvidia Titan V100  GPU , and 73.4% mean IoU with 116.2 FPS when running on higher resolution images.",
