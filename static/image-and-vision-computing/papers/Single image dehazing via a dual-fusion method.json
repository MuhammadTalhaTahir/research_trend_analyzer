    "title": "Single image dehazing via a dual-fusion method",
    "abstract": "Single  image dehazing  is a challenging task because of the hue and brightness distortion problems. In this paper, we propose a dual-fusion method for single image dehazing. By a  segmentation method  creating two divided regions, the sky and non-sky regions can be obtained. To properly optimize the transmission, a multi-region fusion method is proposed for single image smooth. An exposure fusion method is constructed by the brightness transform function to effectively remove the haze from a single image. Experimental results show that this method outperforms state-of-the-art dehazing methods in terms of both efficiency and the dehazing effect.",
