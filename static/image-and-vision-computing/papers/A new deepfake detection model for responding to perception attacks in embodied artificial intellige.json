    "title": "A new deepfake detection model for responding to perception attacks in embodied artificial intelligence",
    "abstract": "Embodied artificial intelligence (AI) represents a new generation of robotics technology combined with artificial intelligence, and it is at the forefront of current research. To reduce the impact of deepfake technology on embodied perception and enhance the security and reliability of embodied AI, this paper proposes a novel deepfake detection model with a new Balanced Contrastive Learning strategy, named BCL. By integrating unsupervised contrastive learning and supervised contrastive learning with deepfake detection, the model effectively extracts the underlying features of fake images from both individual level and category level, thereby leading to more discriminative features. In addition, a Multi-scale Attention Interaction module (MAI) is proposed to enrich the representative ability of features. By cross-fusing the semantic features of different receptive fields of the encoder, more effective deepfake traces can be mined. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has good performance and generalization capabilities across intra-dataset, cross-dataset and cross-manipulation scenarios.",
