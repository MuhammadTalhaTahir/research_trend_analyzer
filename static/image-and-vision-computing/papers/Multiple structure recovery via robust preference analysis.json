    "title": "Multiple structure recovery via robust preference analysis",
    "abstract": "This paper address the extraction of multiple models from outlier-contaminated data by exploiting preference analysis and  low rank approximation . First points are represented in the preference space, then Robust PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Symmetric NMF (Non negative Matrix Factorization) are used to break the multi-model fitting problem into many single-model problems, which in turn are tackled with an approach inspired to MSAC (M-estimator SAmple Consensus) coupled with a model-specific scale estimate. Experimental validation on public, real data-sets demonstrates that our method compares favorably with the state of the art.",
