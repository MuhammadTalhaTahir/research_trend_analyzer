    "title": "Predicting memorability of images using attention-driven spatial pooling and image semantics",
    "abstract": "In daily life, humans demonstrate an amazing ability to remember images they see on magazines, commercials, TV, web pages, etc. but automatic prediction of intrinsic memorability of images using computer vision and  machine learning techniques  has only been investigated very recently. Our goal in this article is to explore the role of visual attention and  image semantics  in understanding image memorability. In particular, we present an attention-driven spatial pooling strategy and show that considering  image features  from the salient parts of images improves the results of the previous models. We also investigate different semantic properties of images by carrying out an analysis of a diverse set of recently proposed  semantic features  which encode meta-level object categories, scene attributes, and invoked feelings. We show that these features which are automatically extracted from images provide memorability predictions as nearly accurate as those derived from human annotations. Moreover, our combined model yields results superior to those of state-of-the art fully automatic models.",
