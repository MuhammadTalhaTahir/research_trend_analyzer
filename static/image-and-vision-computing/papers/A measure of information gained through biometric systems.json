    "title": "A measure of information gained through biometric systems",
    "abstract": "We propose a measure of information gained through  biometric  matching systems. Firstly, we discuss how the information about the identity of a person is derived from biometric samples through a biometric system, and define the “biometric system entropy” or BSE based on  mutual information . We present several theoretical properties and interpretations of the BSE, and show how to design a biometric system which maximizes the BSE. Then we prove that the BSE can be approximated asymptotically by the  relative entropy   D ( f G ( x )∥ f I ( x )) where  f G ( x ) and  f I ( x ) are  probability mass functions  of matching scores between samples from individuals and among population. We also discuss how to evaluate the BSE of a biometric system and show experimental evaluation of the BSE of face, fingerprint and  multimodal biometric systems .",
