    "title": "Marker-based non-overlapping camera calibration methods with additional support camera views",
    "abstract": "Simple methods to calibrate non-overlapping cameras using markers on the cameras are proposed. By adding an  augmented reality  (AR) marker to a camera, we can find the transformation between the fixed AR marker and the camera. With such information, the relative pose between cameras can be found as long as the markers are visible to additional support cameras. The proposed method consists of two steps: (1) use of an extra support camera and a chessboard to find the transformation between the AR marker and the camera and (2) use of the transformation between markers to calibrate non-overlapping cameras. Compared to an existing method, the proposed method works stably and uses fewer images.",
