    "title": "2D progressive fusion module for action recognition",
    "abstract": "Network convergence as well as  recognition accuracy  are essential issues when applying  Convolutional Neural Networks  (CNN) to  human action recognition . Most  deep learning  methods neglect model convergence when striving to improve the abstraction capability, thus degrading the performances sharply when computing resources are limited. To mitigate this problem, we propose a structure named  2D Progressive Fusion  (2DPF) Module which is inserted after the 2D backbone CNN layers. 2DPF fuses features through a novel 2D convolution on the spatial and temporal dimensions called  variation attenuating convolution  and applies fusion techniques to improve the recognition accuracy and the  convergency . Our experiments performed on several benchmarks ( e.g. , Something-Something V1&V2, Kinetics400 & 600, AViD, UCF101) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ARTICLE INFO.",
