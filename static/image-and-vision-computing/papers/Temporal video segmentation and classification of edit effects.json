    "title": "Temporal video segmentation and classification of edit effects",
    "abstract": "The process of shot break detection is a fundamental component in automatic video indexing, editing and archiving. This paper introduces a novel approach to the detection and classification of shot transitions in video sequences including cuts, fades and dissolves. It uses the average inter-frame  correlation coefficient  and block-based motion estimation to track image blocks through the video sequence and to distinguish changes caused by shot transitions from those caused by camera and object motion. We present a number of experiments in which we achieve better results compared with two established techniques.",
