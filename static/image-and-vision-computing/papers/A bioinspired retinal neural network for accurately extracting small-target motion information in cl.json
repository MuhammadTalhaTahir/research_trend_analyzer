    "title": "A bioinspired retinal neural network for accurately extracting small-target motion information in cluttered backgrounds",
    "abstract": "Robust and accurate detection of small moving targets in cluttered moving backgrounds is a significant and challenging problem for robotic visual systems to perform search and tracking tasks. Inspired by the neural circuitry of elementary motion vision in the mammalian retina, this paper proposes a bioinspired retinal  neural network  based on a new neurodynamics-based  temporal filtering  and multiform 2-D spatial Gabor filtering. This model can estimate motion direction accurately via only two perpendicular spatiotemporal filtering signals, and respond to small targets of different sizes and velocities through adjusting the dendrite field size of  spatial filter . Meanwhile, an algorithm of directionally selective inhibition is proposed to suppress the target-like features in the moving background, which can reduce the influence of background motion effectively. Extensive synthetic and real-data experiments show that the proposed model works stably for small targets of a wider size and velocity range, and has better detection performance than other bioinspired models. Additionally, it can also extract the information of motion direction and motion energy accurately and rapidly.",
