    "title": "A novel companion objective function for regularization of deep convolutional neural networks",
    "abstract": "Regularization  is an essential technique discussed in an attempt to solve the overfitting problem in deep convolutional  neural networks  (CNNs). In this paper, we proposed a novel companion objective function as a regularization strategy to boost the classification performance in deep  CNNs . Three aspects of this companion objective function are studied. Firstly, we proposed two kinds of  auxiliary  supervision for  convolutional filters  and non-linear activations respectively in the companion objective function. Both of them enhanced the performance by aleviating the overfitting problem and auxiliary supervision for non-linear activations provided more efficiency. Secondly, regularization of auxiliary supervision in the pre-training phrase is discussed. With the assistance of auxiliary supervision, CNNs could obtain a more favorable initialization for end-to-end supervised fine-tuning. Finally, this companion objective function is verified to be compatible with other regularization strategies such as dropout and  data augmentation . Experimental results on benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrated advantages of our proposed companion objective function as a regularization approach.",
