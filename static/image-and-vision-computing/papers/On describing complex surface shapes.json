    "title": "On describing complex surface shapes",
    "abstract": "The fractal surface model 1  is extended to provide a formalism that is competent to describe complex, natural three-dimensional surfaces in either a quantitative or qualitative manner and which, in addition, closely mimics human perceptual judgments of surface structure (eg ‘peaks’, ‘ridges’ or ‘valleys’) and threedimensional texture. This representation is then used to develop a statistical version of scale-space filtering that is applicable to one-, two- or three-dimensional data.",
