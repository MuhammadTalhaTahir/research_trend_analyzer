    "title": "Human tracking using 3D surface colour distributions",
    "abstract": "A likelihood formulation for detailed  human tracking  in real-world scenes is presented. In this formulation, the appearance, modelled using feature distributions defined over regions on the surface of an articulated 3D model, is estimated and propagated as part of the state. The benefit of such a formulation over currently used techniques is that it provides a dense, highly discriminatory object-based cue that applies in real world scenes. Multi-dimensional histograms are used to represent the feature distributions and an on-line  clustering algorithm , driven by prior knowledge of clothing structure, is derived that enhances appearance estimation and computational efficiency. An investigation of the likelihood model shows its profile to be smooth and broad while region grouping is shown to improve localisation and discrimination. These properties of the likelihood model ease pose estimation by allowing coarse, hierarchical sampling and  local optimisation .",
