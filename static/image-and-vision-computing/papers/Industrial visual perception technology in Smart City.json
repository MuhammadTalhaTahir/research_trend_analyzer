    "title": "Industrial visual perception technology in Smart City",
    "abstract": "In order to study the application effect and function of industrial visual perception technology in smart city, the  image processing  and quality evaluation system was constructed by using  convolutional neural network  (CNN) and Internet of things (IoT) technology. The system was simulated, and then the quality performance of image and video obtained by using industrial visual perception technology was processed and analyzed. The results show that in the analysis of image  local optimization  effect, it is found that the classification performance of all algorithms decreases with the increase of noise, and the performance of local  anisotropic  mode (LAP) is superior, which has strong robustness to rotation, illumination, and noise. In the analysis of  image feature  similarity effect, it is found that the chi square distance between Log  Gabor features  is positively correlated with the degree of image distortion, and the validity of the measurement method is verified. Further analysis of the video processing effect of industrial visual perception technology shows that the video processing effect of test algorithm is significantly better than that of HM16.8 by comparing the distortion performance of the two algorithms with different sequences, with low distortion and significantly improved performance. Therefore, through the research, it is found that the improved  CNN algorithm  is superior to other algorithms in image and video processing.",
