    "title": "Representing cyclic human motion using functional analysis",
    "abstract": "We present a robust automatic method for modeling cyclic 3D human motion such as walking using motion-capture data. The pose of the body is represented by a time-series of joint angles which are automatically segmented into a sequence of motion cycles. The mean and the  principal components  of these cycles are computed using a new algorithm that enforces smooth transitions between the cycles by operating in the  Fourier domain . Key to this method is its ability to automatically deal with noise and missing data. A learned walking model is then exploited for Bayesian tracking of 3D human motion.",
