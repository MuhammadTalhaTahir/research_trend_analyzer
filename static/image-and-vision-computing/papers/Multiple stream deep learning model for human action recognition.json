    "title": "Multiple stream deep learning model for human action recognition",
    "abstract": "Human action recognition  is one of the most important and challenging topic in the fields of  image processing . Unlike object recognition, action recognition requires motion feature modeling which contains not only spatial but also temporal information. In this paper, we use multiple models to characterize both global and local motion features. Global motion patterns are represented efficiently by the depth-based 3-channel motion history images (MHIs). Meanwhile, the local spatial and temporal patterns are extracted from the skeleton graph. The decisions of these two streams are fused. At the end, the domain knowledge, which is the object/action dependency is considered. The proposed framework is evaluated on two RGB-D datasets. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The performance is comparable with the state-of-the-art.",
