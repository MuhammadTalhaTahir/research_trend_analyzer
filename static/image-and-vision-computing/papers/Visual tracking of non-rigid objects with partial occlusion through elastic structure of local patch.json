    "title": "Visual tracking of non-rigid objects with partial occlusion through elastic structure of local patches and hierarchical diffusion",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a tracking method based on sequential Bayesian inference is proposed. The proposed method focuses on solving both the problem of tracking under  partial occlusions  and the problem of non-rigid object tracking in real-time on a desktop  personal computer  (PC). The proposed method is mainly composed of two parts: (1) modeling the target object using  elastic structure  of local patches for robust performance; and (2) efficient hierarchical diffusion method to perform the tracking procedure in real-time. The elastic structure of local patches allows the proposed method to handle partial occlusions and non-rigid deformations through the relationship among neighboring patches. The proposed hierarchical diffusion method  generates samples  from the region where the posterior is concentrated to reduce  computation time . The method is extensively tested on a number of challenging image sequences with occlusion and non-rigid deformation. The experimental results show the real-time capability and the robustness of the proposed method under various situations.",
