    "title": "On Multiprocessor System Scheduling",
    "abstract": "We show that there is a good algorithm for scheduling the average completion time of a set of unknown DAGs (i.e., data dependency relation graphs of programs) on a multiprocessor in the PRAM model (Karp and Ramachandran, 1990) (orother similar shared memory models.) Then, we show that a large class ofparallel jobs can be scheduled with near-optimal average completion time in the BSP model (Valiant, 1990a) though this is not possible for theclass of all unknown DAGs (Deng and Koutsoupias, 1993) (the same holds forother similar distributed memory models.)",
