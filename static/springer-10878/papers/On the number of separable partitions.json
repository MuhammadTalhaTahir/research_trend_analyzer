    "title": "On the number of separable partitions",
    "abstract": "Consider partitions of a given set A of n distinct points in general position in ‚Ñù d into parts where each pair of parts can be separated by a hyperplane that contains a given set of points E. We consider the problem of counting and generating all such partitions (correcting a classic 1967 result of Harding about the number of such partitions into two parts). Applications of the result to partition problems are presented.",
