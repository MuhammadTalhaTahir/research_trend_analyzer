    "title": "(1+ε)-competitive algorithm for online OVSF code assignment with resource augmentation",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the online Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor (OVSF) code assignment problem with resource augmentation introduced by Erlebach et al. (in STACS 2004. LNCS, vol.&nbsp;2996, pp.&nbsp;270–281, 2004). We propose a (1+1/α)-competitive algorithm with help of (1+⌈α⌉)lg∗ h trees for the height h of the OVSF code tree and any α≥1. In other words, it is a (1+ε)-competitive algorithm with help of (1+⌈1/ε⌉)lg∗ h trees for any constant 0&lt;ε≤1. In the case of α=1 (or ε=1), we obtain a 2-competitive algorithm with 2lg∗ h trees, which substantially improves the previous resource of 3h/8+2 trees shown by Chan et&nbsp;al. (COCOON 2009. LNCS, vol.&nbsp;5609, pp.&nbsp;358–367, 2009). In another aspect, if it is not necessary to bound the incurred cost for individual requests to a constant, an amortized (4/3+δ)-competitive algorithm with (11/4+4/(3δ)) trees for any 0&lt;δ≤4/3 is also designed in Chan et&nbsp;al. (COCOON 2009. LNCS, vol.&nbsp;5609, pp.&nbsp;358–367, 2009). The algorithm in this paper gives us a new trade-off between the competitive ratio and the resource augmentation when α≥3 (or ε≤1/3), although the incurred cost for individual requests is bounded to a constant.",
