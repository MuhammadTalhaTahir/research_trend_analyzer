    "title": "On the 2-rainbow domination stable graphs",
    "abstract": "For a graph G, let $$f:V(G)\\rightarrow {\\mathcal {P}}(\\{1,2\\}).$$ If for each vertex $$v\\in V(G)$$ such that $$f(v)=\\emptyset $$ we have $$\\bigcup \\nolimits _{u\\in N(v)}f(u)=\\{1,2\\}, $$ then f is called a 2-rainbow dominating function (2RDF) of G. The weightw(f) of f is defined as $$w(f)=\\sum _{v\\in V(G)}\\left| f(v)\\right| $$ . The minimum weight of a 2RDF of G is called the 2-rainbow domination number of G, which is denoted by $$\\gamma _{r2}(G)$$ . A graph G is 2-rainbow domination stable if the 2-rainbow domination number of G remains unchanged under removal of any vertex. In this paper, we prove that determining whether a graph is 2-rainbow domination stable is NP-hard and characterize 2-rainbow domination stable trees.",
