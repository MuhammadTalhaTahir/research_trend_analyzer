    "title": "On the relationship between energy complexity and other boolean function measures",
    "abstract": "We focus on energy complexity, a Boolean function measure related closely to Boolean circuit design. Given a circuit $$\\mathcal {C}$$ over the standard basis $$\\{\\vee _2,\\wedge _2,\\lnot \\}$$ , the energy complexity of $$\\mathcal {C}$$ , denoted by $${{\\,\\mathrm{EC}\\,}}(\\mathcal {C})$$ , is the maximum number of its activated inner gates over all inputs. The energy complexity of a Boolean function f, denoted by $${{\\,\\mathrm{EC}\\,}}(f)$$ , is the minimum of $${{\\,\\mathrm{EC}\\,}}(\\mathcal {C})$$ over all circuits $$\\mathcal {C}$$ computing f. Recently, K. Dinesh et al. (International computing and combinatorics conference, Springer, Berlin, 738â€“750, 2018) gave $${{\\,\\mathrm{EC}\\,}}(f)$$ an upper bound by the decision tree complexity, $${{\\,\\mathrm{EC}\\,}}(f)=O({{\\,\\mathrm{D}\\,}}(f)^3)$$ . On the input size n, They also showed that $${{\\,\\mathrm{EC}\\,}}(f)$$ is at most $$3n-1$$ . For the lower bound side, they showed that $${{\\,\\mathrm{EC}\\,}}(f)\\ge \\frac{1}{3}{{\\,\\mathrm{psens}\\,}}(f)$$ , where $${{\\,\\mathrm{psens}\\,}}(f)$$ is called positive sensitivity. A remained open problem is whether the energy complexity of a Boolean function has a polynomial relationship with its decision tree complexity. Our results for energy complexity can be listed below.",
