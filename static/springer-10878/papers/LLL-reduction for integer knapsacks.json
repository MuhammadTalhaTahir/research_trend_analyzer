    "title": "LLL-reduction for integer knapsacks",
    "abstract": "Given a matrix A∈ℤ m×n satisfying certain regularity assumptions, a well-known integer programming problem asks to find an integer point in the associated knapsack polytope or determine that no such point exists. We obtain an LLL-based polynomial time algorithm that solves the problem subject to a constraint on the location of the vector b.",
