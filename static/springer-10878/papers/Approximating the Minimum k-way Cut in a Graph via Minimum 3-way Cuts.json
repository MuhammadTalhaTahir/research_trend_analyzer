    "title": "Approximating the Minimum k-way Cut in a Graph via Minimum 3-way Cuts",
    "abstract": "For an edge weighted undirected graph G and an integer k &gt; 2, a k-way cut is a set of edges whose removal leaves G with at least k components. We propose a simple approximation algorithm to the minimum k-way cut problem. It computes a nearly optimal k-way cut by using a set of minimum 3-way cuts. We show that the performance ratio of our algorithm is 2 − 3/k for an odd k and 2 − (3k − 4)/(k 2 − k) for an even k. The running time is O(kmn 3 log(n 2/m)) where n and m are the numbers of vertices and edges respectively.",
