    "title": "Bounds for the traveling salesman paths of two-dimensional modular lattices",
    "abstract": "We present tight upper and lower bounds for the traveling salesman path through the points of two-dimensional modular lattices. We use these results to bound the traveling salesman path of two-dimensional Kronecker point sets. Our results rely on earlier work on shortest vectors in lattices as well as on the strong convergence of Jacobiâ€“Perron type algorithms.",
