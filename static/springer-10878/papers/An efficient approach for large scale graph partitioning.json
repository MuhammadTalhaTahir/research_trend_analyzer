    "title": "An efficient approach for large scale graph partitioning",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of partitioning the set of vertices of a graph intok subsets of approximately the same cardinality in such a way that the number of edges whose endpoints are in different subsets is minimized. A greedy heuristic, called Procedure1, based on the independent growth of each subset by fronts is proposed for constructing a good-quality graph partition. In addition, we present a more sophisticated version of the greedy heuristic, called Procedure2, which periodically calls a routine to refine the partition being built. We show that the partitions generated by Procedure1 are competitive with those obtained by several constructive heuristics in the literature, e.g. spectral, geometric, as well as other greedy heuristics. Moreover, the partitions produced by Procedure2 are compared with those produced by a leading graph partitioning method in the literature.",
