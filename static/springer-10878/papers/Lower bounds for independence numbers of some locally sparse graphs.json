    "abstract": "An $$m$$ -distinct-coloring is a proper vertex-coloring $$c$$ of a graph $$G$$ if for each vertex $$v\\in V$$ , any color appears in at most one of $$N_0(v)$$ , $$N_1(v)$$ , $$\\ldots $$ , and $$N_m(v)$$ , where $$N_i(v)$$ is the set of vertices at distance $$i$$ from $$v$$ . In this note, we show that if $$G$$ is $$C_{2m+1}$$ -free which is assigned an $$(m+1)$$ -distinct-coloring $$c$$ , then $$\\alpha (G)c(G)^{1/m}\\ge \\Omega \\Big (\\sum _{v} c(v)^{1/m}\\Big )$$ , where $$c(G)$$ is the number of colors used in $$c$$ and $$c(v)$$ is the number of different colors appearing in $$N_1(v)$$ . Moreover, we obtain that if $$G$$ has $$N$$ vertices and it contains neither $$C_{2m+1}$$ nor $$C_{2m}$$ , then $$\\alpha (G)\\ge \\Omega \\big ((N\\log N)^{m/(m+1)}\\big )$$ . The algorithm in the proof for the first result is random, and that for the second is constructive.",
