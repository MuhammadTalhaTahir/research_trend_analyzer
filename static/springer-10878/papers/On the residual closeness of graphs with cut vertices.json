    "title": "On the residual closeness of graphs with cut vertices",
    "abstract": "In designing and understanding of computer networks, how to improve network robustness or protect a network from vulnerability remains an overarching concern. The residual closeness is a measure of network vulnerability and robustness even when the removal of vertices does not disconnect the underlying graph. We determine all the graphs that minimize and maximize the residual closeness respectively over all n-vertex connected graphs with r cut vertices, where $$1\\le r\\le n-3$$ .",
