    "title": "The maximum Wiener index of maximal planar graphs",
    "abstract": "The Wiener index of a connected graph is the sum of the distances between all pairs of vertices in the graph. It was conjectured that the Wiener index of an n-vertex maximal planar graph is at most $$\\lfloor \\frac{1}{18}(n^3+3n^2)\\rfloor $$ . We prove this conjecture and determine the unique n-vertex maximal planar graph attaining this maximum, for every $$ n\\ge 10$$ .",
