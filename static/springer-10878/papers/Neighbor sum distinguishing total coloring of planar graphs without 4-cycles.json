    "abstract": "Let $$G=(V,E)$$ be a graph and $$\\phi : V\\cup E\\rightarrow \\{1,2,\\ldots ,k\\}$$ be a proper total coloring of G. Let f(v) denote the sum of the color on a vertex v and the colors on all the edges incident with v. The coloring $$\\phi $$ is neighbor sum distinguishing if $$f(u)\\ne f(v)$$ for each edge $$uv\\in E(G)$$ . The smallest integer k in such a coloring of G is the neighbor sum distinguishing total chromatic number of G, denoted by $$\\chi _{\\Sigma }''(G)$$ . Pilśniak and Woźniak conjectured that $$\\chi _{\\Sigma }''(G)\\le \\Delta (G)+3$$ for any simple graph. By using the famous Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, we prove that $$\\chi _{\\Sigma }''(G)\\le \\max \\{\\Delta (G)+2, 10\\}$$ for planar graph G without 4-cycles. The bound $$\\Delta (G)+2$$ is sharp if $$\\Delta (G)\\ge 8$$ .",
