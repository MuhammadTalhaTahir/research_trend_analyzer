    "title": "Evaluation performance of genetic algorithm and tabu search algorithm for solving the Max-RWA problem in all-optical networks",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we deal with the static Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem in networks with no wavelength converters, and where a given static set of connection demands is prearranged. Our objective is to maximize the number of optical connection-requests that can be established for a given number of wavelengths. A mathematical formulation for Max-RWA was presented. In this article, we implement and compare the performance of two random search algorithms namely: the genetic algorithm and the tabu search algorithm. Using these metaheuristics we solved approximately the wavelength assignment problem for Max-RWA while we computed its routing by a deterministic method which is the backtracking. Therefore we conducted many extensive experiments under different circumstances. Diagrams and representative numerical examples indicate the accuracy of our algorithms.",
