    "title": "The hamiltonian numbers in digraphs",
    "abstract": "In the paper, we study the hamiltonian numbers in digraphs. A&nbsp;hamiltonian walk of a digraph D is a closed spanning directed walk with minimum length in D. The length of a hamiltonian walk of a digraph D is called the hamiltonian number of D, denoted h(D). We prove that if a digraph D of order n is strongly connected, then $n\\leq h(D)\\leq\\lfloor\\frac{(n+1)^{2}}{4} \\rfloor$ , and hence characterize the strongly connected digraphs of order n with hamiltonian number $\\lfloor\\frac{(n+1)^{2}}{4} \\rfloor$ . In addition, we show that for each k with $4\\leq n\\leq k\\leq\\lfloor \\frac{(n+1)^{2}}{4} \\rfloor$ , there exists a digraph with order n and hamiltonian number k. Furthermore, we also study the hamiltonian spectra of graphs.",
