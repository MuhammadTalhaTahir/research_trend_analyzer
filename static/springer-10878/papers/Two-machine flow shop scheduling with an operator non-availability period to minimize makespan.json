    "title": "Two-machine flow shop scheduling with an operator non-availability period to minimize makespan",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the two-machine flow shop scheduling with an operator non-availability period in the first stage to minimize makespan, where the operator non-availability period is an open time interval in which a job can neither start nor complete. We first prove that the problem is NP-hard, even if the length of the operator non-availability period is no more than the processing time of any job on the first machine. Then we show that Johnsonâ€™s rule is a 2-approximation algorithm and the bound is tight. Moreover, a better tight 3/2-approximation algorithm is provided.",
