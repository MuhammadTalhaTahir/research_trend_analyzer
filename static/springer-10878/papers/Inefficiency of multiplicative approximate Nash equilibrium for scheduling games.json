    "title": "Inefficiency of multiplicative approximate Nash equilibrium for scheduling games",
    "abstract": "This paper studies the inefficiency of multiplicative approximate Nash Equilibrium for scheduling games. There is a set of machines and a set of jobs. Each job could choose one machine and be processed by the chosen one. A schedule is a $$\\theta $$ -NE if no player has the incentive to deviate so that it decreases its cost by a factor larger than $$1+\\theta $$ . The $$\\theta $$ -NE is a generation of Nash Equilibrium and its inefficiency can be measured by the $$\\theta $$ -PoA, which is also a generalization of the Price of Anarchy. For the game with the social cost of minimizing the makespan, the exact $$\\theta $$ -PoA for any number of machines and any $$\\theta \\ge 0$$ is obtained. For the game with the social cost of maximizing the minimum machine load, we present upper and lower bounds on the $$\\theta $$ -PoA. Tight bounds are provided for cases where the number of machines is between 2 and 7 and for any $$\\theta \\ge 0$$ .",
