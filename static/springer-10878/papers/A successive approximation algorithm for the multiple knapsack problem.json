    "title": "A successive approximation algorithm for the multiple knapsack problem",
    "abstract": "It is well-known that the multiple knapsack problem is NP-hard, and does not admit an FPTAS even for the case of two identical knapsacks. Whereas the 0-1 knapsack problem with only one knapsack has been intensively studied, and some effective exact or approximation algorithms exist. A&nbsp;natural approach for the multiple knapsack problem is to pack the knapsacks successively by using an effective algorithm for the 0-1 knapsack problem. This paper considers such an approximation algorithm that packs the knapsacks in the nondecreasing order of their capacities. We analyze this algorithm for 2 and 3 knapsack problems by the worst-case analysis method and give all their error bounds.",
