    "title": "The capture time of a planar graph",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the capture time of a planar graph in a variant of the pursuit-evasion games, called cops and robbers game. Since any planar graph is 3-cop-win, we study the capture time of a planar graph G of n vertices using three cops, which is denoted by $$capt_3(G)$$ . We present a new capture strategy and show that $$capt_3(G) \\le 2n$$ . This is the first result on $$capt_3(G)$$ .",
