    "title": "Optimal RSUs deployment with delay bound along highways in VANET",
    "abstract": "In order to broadcast an alert message from the accident site to the control center as soon as possible, the roadside units (RSUs) act as the critical component in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). It is not possible to make a pervasive RSU deployment due to the huge cost and market requirement. Hence, how to deploy a minimum number of RSUs in a given region becomes a challenge problem. In this paper, we present an analysis for the total delay of broadcasting alert messages in VANETs along highways. Based on the analysis, the relationship between optimal number of RSUs with the highway distance is given. Moreover, the experiment results verifies the delay analysis and the optimization of RSUs deployment.",
