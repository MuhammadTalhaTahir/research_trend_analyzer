    "title": "The minimum number of hubs in networks",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a hub refers to a non-terminal vertex of degree at least three. We study the minimum number of hubs needed in a network to guarantee certain flow demand constraints imposed between multiple pairs of sources and sinks. We prove that under the constraints, regardless of the size of the network, such minimum number is always upper bounded and we derive tight upper bounds for some special parameters. In particular, for two pairs of sources and sinks, we present a novel path-searching algorithm, the analysis of which is instrumental for the derivations of the tight upper bounds. Our results are of both theoretical and practical interest: in theory, they can be viewed as generalizations of the classical Menger’s theorem to a class of undirected graphs with multiple sources and sinks; in practice, our results, roughly speaking, suggest that for some given flow demand constraints, not “too many” hubs are needed in a network.",
