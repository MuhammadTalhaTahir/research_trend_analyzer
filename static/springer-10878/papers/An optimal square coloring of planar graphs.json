    "title": "An optimal square coloring of planar graphs",
    "abstract": "The square coloring of a graph is to color the vertices of a graph at distance at most 2 with different colors. In 1977, Wegner posed a conjecture on square coloring of planar graphs. The conjecture is still open. In this paper, we prove that Wegnerâ€™s conjecture is true for planar graphs with girth at least&nbsp;6.",
