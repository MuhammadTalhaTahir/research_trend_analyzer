    "abstract": "This paper studies an incremental version of the k-center problem with centers constrained to lie on boundary of a convex polygon. In the incremental k-center problem we considered, we are given a set of n demand points inside a convex polygon, facilities are constrained to lie on its boundary. Our algorithm produces an incremental sequence of facility sets $$B_{1}\\subseteq B_{2}\\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq B_{n}$$ , where each $$B_{k}$$ contains k facilities. Such an algorithm is called $$\\alpha $$ -competitive, if for any k, the maximum of the ratio between the value of solution $$B_{k}$$ and the value of an optimal k-center solution is no more than $$\\alpha $$ . We present a polynomial time incremental algorithm with a competitive ratio $$\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$ and we also prove a lower bound of 2.",
