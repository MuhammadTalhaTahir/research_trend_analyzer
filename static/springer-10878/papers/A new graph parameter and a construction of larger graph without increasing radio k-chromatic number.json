    "abstract": "For a positive integer $$k\\ge 2$$ , the radio k-coloring problem is an assignment L of non-negative integers (colors) to the vertices of a finite simple graph G satisfying the condition $$|L(u)-L(v)| \\ge k+1-d(u,v)$$ , for any two distinct vertices u, v of G and d(u,&nbsp;v) being distance between u, v. The span of L is the largest integer assigned by L, while 0 is taken as the smallest color. An $$rc_k$$ -coloring on G is a radio k-coloring on G of minimum span which is referred as the radio k-chromatic number of G and denoted by $$rc_k(G)$$ . An integer h, $$0",
