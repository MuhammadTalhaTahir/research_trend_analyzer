    "title": "Node-weighted Steiner tree approximation in unit disk graphs",
    "abstract": "Given a graph G=(V,E) with node weight w:V→R + and a subset S⊆V, find a minimum total weight tree interconnecting all nodes in&nbsp;S. This is the node-weighted Steiner tree problem which will be studied in this paper. In general, this problem is NP-hard and cannot be approximated by a polynomial time algorithm with performance ratio aln n for any 0",
