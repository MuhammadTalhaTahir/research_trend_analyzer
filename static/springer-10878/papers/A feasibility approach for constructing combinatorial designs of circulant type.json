    "title": "A feasibility approach for constructing combinatorial designs of circulant type",
    "abstract": "In this work, we propose an optimization approach for constructing various classes of circulant combinatorial designs that can be defined in terms of autocorrelation. The problem is formulated as a so-called feasibility problem having three sets, to which the Douglas–Rachford projection algorithm is applied. The approach is illustrated on three different classes of circulant combinatorial designs: circulant weighing matrices, D-optimal matrices of circulant type, and Hadamard matrices with two circulant cores. Furthermore, we explicitly construct two new circulant weighing matrices, a CW(126,&nbsp;64) and a CW(198,&nbsp;100), whose existence was previously marked as unresolved in the most recent version of Strassler’s table.",
