    "title": "Flipping triangles and rectangles",
    "abstract": "We study the chromatic number of the flip graph of triangles determined by n points in convex position in the plane, and present new or improved bounds on several related parameters for this graph. We also find the chromatic numbers of two related graphs: the rectangle flip graph which generalizes the shift graph, and the rolling block graph from the popular puzzle “Rolling Block Maze.”",
