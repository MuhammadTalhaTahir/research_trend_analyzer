    "title": "On the distance paired domination of generalized Petersen graphs P(n,1) and P(n,2)",
    "abstract": "Let G=(V,E) be a graph without an isolated vertex. A set D⊆V(G) is a k -distance paired dominating set of G if D is a k-distance dominating set of G and the induced subgraph 〈D〉 has a perfect matching. The minimum cardinality of a k-distance paired dominating set for graph G is the k -distance paired domination number, denoted by γ (G). In this paper, we determine the exact k-distance paired domination number of generalized Petersen graphs P(n,1) and P(n,2) for all k≥1.",
