    "title": "Quadratic Assignment Problems and M/G/C/C/ State Dependent Network Flows",
    "abstract": "One of the most notorious network design problems is the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). We develop an heuristic algorithm for QAPs along with an M/G/C/C state dependent queueing model for capturing congestion in the traffic system interconnecting the nodes in the network. Computational results are also presented.",
