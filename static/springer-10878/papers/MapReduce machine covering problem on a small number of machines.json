    "title": "MapReduce machine covering problem on a small number of machines",
    "abstract": "We study machine covering problem in MapReduce system. Each job consists of two sets of tasks, namely the map tasks and reduce tasks. A jobâ€™s reduce tasks can only be processed after all its map tasks are finished. The map tasks are fractional, i.e., they can be arbitrarily split and processed on different machines in parallel. Our goal is to maximize the minimum machine completion time. We consider two variants of the problem, namely the cases involving preemptive reduce tasks and non-preemptive reduce tasks. For preemptive reduce tasks, we present optimal solution algorithms for the problem on two and three machines. For non-preemptive reduce tasks, we provide an approximation algorithm with a tight worse-case ratio of $$\\frac{4}{3}$$ for the problem on two machines.",
