    "abstract": "In the paper we study $$\\lambda $$ -numbers of several classes of snarks. We show that the $$\\lambda $$ -number of each Blanu $$\\breve{s}$$ a snark, Flower snark and Goldberg snark is $$6$$ . For $$n\\ge 2$$ , we show that there is a dot product of $$n$$ Petersen graphs such that its $$\\lambda $$ -number is 6.",
