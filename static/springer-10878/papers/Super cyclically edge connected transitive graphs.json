    "title": "Super cyclically edge connected transitive graphs",
    "abstract": "A cyclic edge-cut of a graph&nbsp;G is an edge set, the removal of which separates two cycles. If&nbsp;G has a cyclic edge-cut, then it is called cyclically separable. For a cyclically separable graph&nbsp;G, the cyclic edge-connectivity λ c (G) is the cardinality of a minimum cyclic edge-cut of G. We call a graph super cyclically edge-connected, if the removal of any minimum cyclic edge-cut results in a component which is a shortest cycle. In this paper, we show that a connected vertex-transitive or edge-transitive graph is super cyclically edge-connected if either&nbsp;G is cubic with girth g(G)≥7, or&nbsp;G has minimum degree δ(G)≥4 and girth g(G)≥6.",
