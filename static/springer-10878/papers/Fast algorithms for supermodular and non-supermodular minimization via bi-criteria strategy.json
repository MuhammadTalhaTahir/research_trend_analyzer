    "title": "Fast algorithms for supermodular and non-supermodular minimization via bi-criteria strategy",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we concentrate on exploring fast algorithms for the minimization of a non-increasing supermodular or non-supermodular function f subject to a cardinality constraint. As for the non-supermodular minimization problem with the weak supermodularity ratio r, we can obtain a $$(1+\\epsilon )$$ -approximation algorithm with adaptivity $$O(\\frac{n}{\\epsilon }\\log {\\frac{r n \\cdot f(\\emptyset )}{\\epsilon \\cdot \\mathtt {OPT}}})$$ under the bi-criteria strategy, where $$\\mathtt {OPT}$$ denotes the optimal objective value of the problem. That is, instead of selecting at most k elements on behalf of the constraint, the cardinality of the output may reach to $$\\frac{k}{ r}\\log {\\frac{f(\\emptyset )}{\\epsilon \\cdot \\mathtt {OPT}}}$$ . Moreover, for the supermodular minimization problem, we propose two $$(1+\\epsilon )$$ -approximation algorithms for which the output solution X is of size $$|X_0|+ O\\left( k \\log {\\frac{f(X_0)}{\\epsilon \\cdot \\mathtt {OPT}}}\\right) $$ . The adaptivities of this two algorithms are $$O \\left( \\log ^2n \\cdot \\log \\frac{f(X_0)}{\\epsilon \\cdot \\mathtt {OPT}}\\right) $$ and $$O\\left( \\log n \\cdot \\log \\frac{f(X_0)}{\\epsilon \\cdot \\mathtt {OPT}}\\right) $$ , where $$X_0$$ is an input set and $$\\mathtt {OPT}$$ is the optimal value. Applications to group sparse linear regression problems and fuzzy C-means problems are studied at the end.",
