    "title": "A sharp upper bound for the edge dominating number of hypergraphs with minimum degree",
    "abstract": "In a hypergraph H(V,&nbsp;E), a subset of edges $$A\\subseteq E$$ forms an edge dominating set if each edge $$e\\in E\\setminus A$$ is adjacent to at least one edge in A. The edge dominating number $$\\gamma '(H)$$ represents the smallest size of an edge dominating set in H. In this paper, we establish upper bounds on the edge dominating number for hypergraphs with minimum degree $$\\delta $$ : (1) For $$\\delta \\le 4$$ , $$\\gamma '(H)\\le \\frac{m}{\\delta }$$ ; (2) For $$\\delta \\ge 5$$ , $$\\gamma '(H)\\le \\frac{m}{\\delta }$$ holds for hypertrees and uniform hypergraphs; (3) For a random hypergraph model $$\\mathcal H(n,m)$$ , for any positive number $$\\varepsilon &gt;0$$ , $$\\gamma ' (H)\\le (1+\\varepsilon )\\frac{m}{\\delta }$$ holds with high probability when m is bounded by some polynomial function of n. Based on the proofs, some combinatorial algorithms on the edge dominating number of hypergraphs with minimum degree are designed.",
