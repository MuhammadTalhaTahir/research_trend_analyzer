    "title": "A simple greedy approximation algorithm for the minimum connected $$k$$ -Center problem",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the connected $$k$$ -Center ( $$CkC$$ ) problem, which can be seen as the classic $$k$$ -Center problem with the constraint of internal connectedness, i.e., two nodes in a cluster are required to be connected by an internal path in the same cluster. $$CkC$$ was first introduced by Ge et al. (ACM Trans Knowl Discov Data 2:7, 2008), in which they showed the $$NP$$ -completeness for this problem and claimed a polynomial time approximation algorithm for it. However, the running time of their algorithm might not be polynomial, as one key step of their algorithm involves the computation of an $$NP$$ -hard problem. We first present a simple polynomial time greedy-based $$2$$ -approximation algorithm for the relaxation of $$CkC$$ —the $$CkC^*$$ . Further, we give a $$6$$ -approximation algorithm for $$CkC$$ .",
