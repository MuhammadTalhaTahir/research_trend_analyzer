    "abstract": "A hamiltonian walk of a digraph is a closed spanning directed walk with minimum length in the digraph. The length of a hamiltonian walk in a digraph D is called the hamiltonian number of D, denoted by h(D). In Chang and Tong (J Comb Optim 25:694â€“701, 2013), Chang and Tong proved that for a strongly connected digraph D of order n, $$n\\le h(D)\\le \\lfloor \\frac{(n+1)^2}{4} \\rfloor $$ , and characterized the strongly connected digraphs of order n with hamiltonian number $$\\lfloor \\frac{(n+1)^2}{4} \\rfloor $$ . In the paper, we characterized the strongly connected digraphs of order n with hamiltonian number $$\\lfloor \\frac{(n+1)^2}{4} \\rfloor -1$$ and show that for any triple of integers n, k and t with $$n\\ge 5$$ , $$n\\ge k\\ge 3$$ and $$t\\ge 0$$ , there is a class of nonisomorphic digraphs with order n and hamiltonian number $$n(n-k+1)-t$$ .",
