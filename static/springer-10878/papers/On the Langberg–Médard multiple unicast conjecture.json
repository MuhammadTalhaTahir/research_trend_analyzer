    "title": "On the Langberg–Médard multiple unicast conjecture",
    "abstract": "A version of the multiple unicast conjecture, proposed by Langberg and Médard (in: Proceedings of 47th annual Allerton, 2009), says that, there exists an undirected fractional multi-commodity flow, or simply, multi-flow, with rate $$(1,1,\\ldots ,1)$$ for strongly reachable networks. In this paper, we propose a nonsmooth matrix optimization problem to attack this conjecture: By giving upper and lower bounds on the objective value, we prove that there exists a multi-flow with rate at least $$(\\frac{8}{9}, \\frac{8}{9}, \\ldots , \\frac{8}{9})$$ for such networks; on the other hand though, we show that the rate of any multi-flow constructed using this framework cannot exceed $$(1,1,\\ldots ,1)$$ .",
