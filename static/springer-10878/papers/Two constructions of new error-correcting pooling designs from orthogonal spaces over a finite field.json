    "title": "Two constructions of new error-correcting pooling designs from orthogonal spaces over a finite field of characteristic 2",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we construct two classes of t×n,s e -disjunct matrix with subspaces in orthogonal space $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{(2\\nu+1)}$ of characteristic 2 and exhibit their disjunct properties. We also prove that the test efficiency t/n of constructions II is smaller than that of D’yachkov et al. (J. Comput. Biol. 12:1129–1136, 2005).",
