    "title": "Acyclic coloring of graphs with some girth restriction",
    "abstract": "A vertex coloring of a graph $$G$$ is called acyclic if it is a proper vertex coloring such that every cycle $$C$$ receives at least three colors. The acyclic chromatic number of $$G$$ is the least number of colors in an acyclic coloring of $$G$$ . We prove that acyclic chromatic number of any graph $$G$$ with maximum degree $$\\Delta \\ge 4$$ and with girth at least $$4\\Delta $$ is at most $$12\\Delta $$ .",
