    "title": "Pooling designs associated with unitary space and ratio efficiency comparison",
    "abstract": "Let $\\mathbb{F}^{(2\\nu+\\delta)}_{q^{2}}$ be a (2ν+δ)-dimensional unitary space of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2}}$ , where δ=0 or 1. In this paper we construct a family of inclusion matrices associated with subspaces of $\\mathbb{F}^{(2\\nu+\\delta)}_{q^{2}}$ , and exhibit its disjunct property. Moreover, we compare the ratio efficiency of this construction with others, and find it smaller under some conditions.",
