    "title": "The $$r$$ -acyclic chromatic number of planar graphs",
    "abstract": "A vertex coloring of a graph G is r-acyclic if it is a proper vertex coloring such that every cycle $$C$$ receives at least $$\\min \\{|C|,r\\}$$ colors. The $$r$$ -acyclic chromatic number $$a_{r}(G)$$ of $$G$$ is the least number of colors in an $$r$$ -acyclic coloring of $$G$$ . Let $$G$$ be a planar graph. By Four Color Theorem, we know that $$a_{1}(G)=a_{2}(G)=\\chi (G)\\le 4$$ , where $$\\chi (G)$$ is the chromatic number of $$G$$ . Borodin proved that $$a_{3}(G)\\le 5$$ . However when $$r\\ge 4$$ , the $$r$$ -acyclic chromatic number of a class of graphs may not be bounded by a constant number. For example, $$a_{4}(K_{2,n})=n+2=\\Delta (K_{2,n})+2$$ for $$n\\ge 2$$ , where $$K_{2,n}$$ is a complete bipartite (planar) graph. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition for $$a_{r}(G)\\le r$$ when $$G$$ is a planar graph. In precise, we show that if $$r\\ge 4$$ and $$G$$ is a planar graph with $$g(G)\\ge \\frac{10r-4}{3}$$ , then $$a_{r}(G)\\le r$$ . In addition, we discuss the $$4$$ -acyclic colorings of some special planar graphs.",
