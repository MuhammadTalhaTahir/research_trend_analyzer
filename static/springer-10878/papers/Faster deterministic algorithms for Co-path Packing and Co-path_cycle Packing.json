    "title": "Faster deterministic algorithms for Co-path Packing and Co-path/cycle Packing",
    "abstract": "In the Co-path Packing (resp., Co-path/cycle Packing) problem, the input is a graph G and an integer k, and the goal is to decide whether there is a set of at most k vertices whose removal from G results in a graph which is a collection of induced paths (resp., induced paths and cycles). In this paper we give deterministic $$O^*(3^k)$$ -time algorithms for Co-path Packing and Co-path/cycle Packing.",
