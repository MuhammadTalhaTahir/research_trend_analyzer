    "title": "Stabilizing social structure via modifying local patterns",
    "abstract": "Study of social structure patterns and their dynamics has attracted more attentions in recent years. Structural measures like structural balance and status theory focus on patterns of signed links and the frequency/popularity of them. Several recent works have tried to define some measures to study the instability of social structure. But these works do not present any idea about the links that changing their signs makes the network more stable. In this paper, we have introduced three algorithms for detecting and changing the sign of links of graph to make it more stable. The results of simulation for a number of scale-free and complete networks show that proposed algorithms have the ability to create more stable patterns. As the proposed algorithms focus on components of the social network to calculate localized measures, it is appropriate for agent based models to study other social phenomena.",
