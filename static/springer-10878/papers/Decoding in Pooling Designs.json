    "title": "Decoding in Pooling Designs",
    "abstract": "Given n clones with some positive ones, the pooling design is a non-adapted algorithm to identify all positive clones. Given a pooling design and outcomes from all pools, how to determine each clone being positive or not. We study this decoding problem in this paper. Especially, we give a new decoding method for error-correcting pooling design with (d,k)-disjunct matrix.",
