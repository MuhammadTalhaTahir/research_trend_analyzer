    "title": "Fractional matching preclusion of the restricted HL-graphs",
    "abstract": "The fractional matching preclusion number of a graph is the minimum number of edges whose deletion results in a graph that has no fractional perfect matchings, and the fractional strong matching preclusion number of a graph is the minimum number of edges and/or vertices whose deletion leaves a resulting graph with no fractional perfect matchings. In this paper, we determine these two numbers for the restricted HL-graphs.",
