    "title": "On the directed cut cone and polytope",
    "abstract": "In this paper we study the directed cut cone and polytope which are the positive hull and convex hull of all directed cut vectors of a complete directed graph, respectively. We present results on the polyhedral structure of these polyhedra. A relation between directed cut polyhedra and undirected cut polyhedra is established that provides families of facet defining inequalities for directed cut polyhedra from those known for undirected cut polyhedra.",
