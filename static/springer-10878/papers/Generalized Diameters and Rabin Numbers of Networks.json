    "title": "Generalized Diameters and Rabin Numbers of Networks",
    "abstract": "Reliability and efficiency are important criteria in the design of interconnection networks. Recently, the w-wide diameter dw(G), the (w − 1)-fault diameter Dw(G), and the w-Rabin number rw(G) have been used to measure network reliability and efficiency. In this paper, we study dw(G), Dw(G) and rw(G) using the strong w-Rabin number rw *(G) for 1 ≤ w ≤ k(G) and G is a circulant network G(dn; {1, d,..., dn −1}), a d-ary cube network C(d, n), a generalized hypercube GH(mn − 1,..., m0), a folded hypercube FH(n) or a WK-recursive network WK(d, t).",
