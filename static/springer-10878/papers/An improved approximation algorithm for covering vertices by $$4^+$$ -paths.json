    "title": "An improved approximation algorithm for covering vertices by $$4^+$$ -paths",
    "abstract": "Path cover is one of the well-known NP-hard problems that has received much attention. In this paper, we study a variant of path cover, denoted by $$\\hbox {MPC}^{{4}+}_v$$ , to cover as many vertices in a given graph $$G = (V, E)$$ as possible by a collection of vertex-disjoint paths each of order four or above. The problem admits an existing $$O(|V|^8)$$ -time 2-approximation algorithm by applying several time-consuming local improvement operations (Gong et al.: Proceedings of MFCS 2022, LIPIcs 241, pp 53:1â€“53:14, 2022). In contrast, our new algorithm uses a completely different method and it is an improved $$O(\\min \\{|E|^2|V|^2, |V|^5\\})$$ -time 1.874-approximation algorithm, which answers the open question in Gong et al. (2022) in the affirmative. An important observation leading to the improvement is that the number of vertices in a maximum matching M of G is relatively large compared to that in an optimal solution of $$\\hbox {MPC}^{{4}+}_v$$ . Our new algorithm forms a feasible solution of $$\\hbox {MPC}^{{4}+}_v$$ from a maximum matching M by computing a maximum-weight path-cycle cover in an auxiliary graph to connect as many edges in M as possible.",
