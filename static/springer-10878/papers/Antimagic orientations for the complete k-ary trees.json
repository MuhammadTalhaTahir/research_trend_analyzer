    "title": "Antimagic orientations for the complete k-ary trees",
    "abstract": "A labeling of a digraph D with m arcs is a bijection from the set of arcs of D to $$\\{1,2,\\ldots ,m\\}$$ . A labeling of D is antimagic if all vertex-sums of vertices in D are pairwise distinct, where the vertex-sum of a vertex $$u \\in V(D)$$ for a labeling is the sum of labels of all arcs entering u minus the sum of labels of all arcs leaving u. Hefetz et al. (J Graph Theory 64:219–232, 2010) conjectured that every connected graph admits an antimagic orientation. We support this conjecture for the complete k-ary trees and show that all the complete k-ary trees $$T_k^r$$ with height r have antimagic orientations for any k and r.",
