    "title": "A surgical scheduling method considering surgeons’ preferences",
    "abstract": "A surgical scheduling method considering surgeons’ preferences to the time segments has been designed. The one whole day’s work time of an operation room is seen as a kind of resource. According to the number of surgeons who applied for this operation room, the time is divided into corresponding time segments. Time segments and surgeons are seen as two sides of matching problem, the preference functions of two sides have been defined, and the model has been developed based on two-sided matching theory, then the solution of the model has been presented. An example showed that the satisfactions of surgeons have been improved obviously based on the efficient use of time resources.",
