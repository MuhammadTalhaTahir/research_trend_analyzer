    "title": "On the SVP for low-dimensional circulant lattices",
    "abstract": "Lattice is the main research subject in the geometry of numbers. SVP refers to finding a shortest nonzero lattice vector in a given lattice, which is thought to be a difficult optimization problem. For general lattice, the integer coefficients of a shortest nonzero vector under a lattice basis might be exponentially large, thus making the simple integer coefficient searching approach impractical. In this paper, we find that for low-dimensional circulant lattices(dimension $$n \\in \\{2,3,4,6\\}$$ ), the integer coefficients of a shortest lattice vector under its circulant basis are actually in a small set $$S=\\{-1,0,1\\}$$ , which makes it easy to find the shortest vector in these cases. Moreover, we present the specific forms of the SVP solutions for low-dimensional circulant lattices.",
