    "title": "Monotonicity of strong searching on digraphs",
    "abstract": "Given a digraph, suppose that some intruders hide on vertices or along edges of the digraph. We want to find the minimum number of searchers required to capture all the intruders hiding in the digraph. In this paper, we propose and study two digraph searching models: strong searching and mixed strong searching. In these two search models, searchers can move either from tail to head or from head to tail when they slide along edges, but intruders must follow the edge directions when they move along edges. We prove the monotonicity of each model respectively, and show that both searching problems are NP-complete.",
