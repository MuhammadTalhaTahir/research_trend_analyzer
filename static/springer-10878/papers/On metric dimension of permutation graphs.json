    "title": "On metric dimension of permutation graphs",
    "abstract": "The metric dimension $$\\dim (G)$$ of a graph $$G$$ is the minimum number of vertices such that every vertex of $$G$$ is uniquely determined by its vector of distances to the set of chosen vertices. Let $$G_1$$ and $$G_2$$ be disjoint copies of a graph $$G$$ , and let $$\\sigma : V(G_1) \\rightarrow V(G_2)$$ be a permutation. Then, a permutation graph $$G_{\\sigma }=(V, E)$$ has the vertex set $$V=V(G_1) \\cup V(G_2)$$ and the edge set $$E=E(G_1) \\cup E(G_2) \\cup \\{uv \\mid v=\\sigma (u)\\}$$ . We show that $$2 \\le \\dim (G_{\\sigma }) \\le n-1$$ for any connected graph $$G$$ of order $$n$$ at least $$3$$ . We give examples showing that neither is there a function $$f$$ such that $$\\dim (G)\\dim (G_{\\sigma })$$ for all pairs $$(G, \\sigma )$$ . Further, we characterize permutation graphs $$G_{\\sigma }$$ satisfying $$\\dim (G_{\\sigma })=n-1$$ when $$G$$ is a complete $$k$$ -partite graph, a cycle, or a path on $$n$$ vertices.",
