    "title": "Heuristics for the network design problem with connectivity requirements",
    "abstract": "We consider the NP-complete problem of finding a spanning $$k$$ -tree of minimum weight in a complete weighted graph. This problem has a number of applications in designing reliable backbone telecommunication networks. We propose effective algorithms based on a greedy strategy and several variable neighborhood search metaheuristics. We also develop an integer linear programming model for calculating a lower bound. Preliminary numerical experiments using random and real-word data sets are reported to show the effectiveness of our approach. In addition, we compare our approach with known metaheuristics.",
