    "title": "The 2-surviving rate of planar graphs without 5-cycles",
    "abstract": "Let $$G$$ be a connected graph with $$n\\ge 2$$ vertices. Let $$k\\ge 1$$ be an integer. Suppose that a fire breaks out at a vertex $$v$$ of $$G$$ . A firefighter starts to protect vertices. At each step, the firefighter protects $$k$$ -vertices not yet on fire. At the end of each step, the fire spreads to all the unprotected vertices that have a neighbour on fire. Let $$\\hbox {sn}_k(v)$$ denote the maximum number of vertices in $$G$$ that the firefighter can save when a fire breaks out at vertex $$v$$ . The $$k$$ -surviving rate $$\\rho _k(G)$$ of $$G$$ is defined to be $$\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum _{v\\in V(G)} {\\hbox {sn}}_{k}(v)$$ , which is the average proportion of saved vertices. In this paper, we prove that if $$G$$ is a planar graph with $$n\\ge 2$$ vertices and without 5-cycles, then $$\\rho _2(G)&gt;\\frac{1}{363}$$ .",
