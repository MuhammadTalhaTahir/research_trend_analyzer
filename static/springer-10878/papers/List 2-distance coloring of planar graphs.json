    "title": "List 2-distance coloring of planar graphs",
    "abstract": "The $$2$$ -distance coloring of a graph $$G$$ is to color the vertices of $$G$$ so that every two vertices at distance at most $$2$$ from each other get different colors. Let $$\\chi _{2}^{l}(G)$$ be the list 2-distance chromatic number of $$G$$ . In this paper, we show that (1) a planar graph $$G$$ with $$\\Delta (G)\\ge 12$$ which contains no $$3,5$$ -cycles and intersecting 4-cycles has $$\\chi _{2}^{l}(G)\\le \\Delta +6$$ ; (2) a planar graph $$G$$ with $$\\Delta (G)\\le 5$$ and $$g(G)\\ge 5$$ has $$\\chi _{2}^{l}(G)\\le 13$$ .",
