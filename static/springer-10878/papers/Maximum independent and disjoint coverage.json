    "title": "Maximum independent and disjoint coverage",
    "abstract": "Set cover is one of the most studied optimization problems in Computer Science. In this paper, we target two interesting variations of this problem in a geometric setting: (i) maximum disjoint coverage (MDC), and (ii) maximum independent coverage (MIC) problems. In both problems, the input consists of a set P of points and a set O of geometric objects in the plane. The objective is to maximize the number of points covered by a set $$O'$$ of selected objects from O. In the MDC&nbsp;problem we restrict the objects in $$O'$$ are pairwise disjoint (non-intersecting). Whereas, in the MIC&nbsp;problem any pair of objects in $$O'$$ should not share a point from P (however, they may intersect each other). We consider various geometric objects as covering objects such as axis-parallel infinite lines, axis-parallel line segments, unit disks, axis-parallel unit squares, and intervals on a real line. For the covering objects axis-parallel infinite lines, we show that both MDC&nbsp;and MIC&nbsp;problems admit polynomial time algorithms. In addition to that, we give polynomial time algorithms for both MDC&nbsp;and MIC&nbsp;problems with intervals on the real line. On the other hand, we prove that the MIC&nbsp;problem is $${\\mathsf {NP}}$$-complete when the objects are horizontal infinite lines and vertical segments. We also prove that both MDC&nbsp;and MIC&nbsp;problems are $${\\mathsf {NP}}$$-complete for axis-parallel unit segments in the plane. For unit disks and axis-parallel unit squares, we prove that both these problems are $${\\mathsf {NP}}$$-complete. Further, we present $${\\mathsf {PTAS}}$$ es for the MDC&nbsp;problem for unit disks as well as unit squares using Hochbaum and Maass’s “shifting strategy”. For unit squares, we design a $${\\mathsf {PTAS}}$$&nbsp;for the MIC&nbsp;problem using Chan and Hu’s “mod-one transformation” technique.",
