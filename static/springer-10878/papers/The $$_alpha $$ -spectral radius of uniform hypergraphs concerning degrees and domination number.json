    "title": "The $$\\alpha $$ -spectral radius of uniform hypergraphs concerning degrees and domination number",
    "abstract": "For $$0\\le \\alpha &lt;1$$ and an r-uniform hypergraph H, the $$\\alpha $$ -spectral radius of H is the maximum modulus of eigenvalues of $$\\alpha {\\mathcal {D}}(H)+(1-\\alpha ){\\mathcal {A}}(H)$$ , where $${\\mathcal {D}}(H)$$ and $${\\mathcal {A}}(H)$$ are the diagonal tensor of degrees and the adjacency tensor of H, respectively. In this paper, we give a lower bound on the $$\\alpha $$ -spectral radius of a linear r-uniform hypergraph in terms of its domination number. Then, we obtain some bounds on the $$\\alpha $$ -spectral radius in terms of vertex degrees and we characterize the extremal hypergraphs attaining the bound.",
