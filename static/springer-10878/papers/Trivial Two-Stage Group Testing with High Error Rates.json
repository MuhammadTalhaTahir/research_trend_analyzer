    "title": "Trivial Two-Stage Group Testing with High Error Rates",
    "abstract": "Given a population of cardinality q r that contains a positive subset P of cardinality p, we give a trivial two-stage method that has $${\\text{(}}_2^{{\\text{(}}r{\\text{ + 1)}}q} ) - r(_2^q )$$ first stage pools each of which contains q r − 2 objects. We assume that errors occur in the first stage. We give an algorithm that uses the results of first stage to generate a set CP of candidate positives with |CP| ≤ (r + 1)q. We give the expected value of |CP∩P|. At most (r + 1)q trivial second stage tests are needed to identify all the positives in CP. We assume that the second stage tests are error free.",
