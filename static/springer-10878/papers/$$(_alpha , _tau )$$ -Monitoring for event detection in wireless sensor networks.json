    "title": "$$(\\alpha , \\tau )$$ -Monitoring for event detection in wireless sensor networks",
    "abstract": "Detecting abnormal events is one of the fundamental issues in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we investigate $$(\\alpha ,\\tau )$$ -monitoring in WSNs. For a given monitored threshold $$\\alpha $$ , we prove that (i) the tight upper bound of $$\\Pr [{S(t)} \\ge \\alpha ]$$ is $$O\\left( {\\exp \\left\\{ { - n\\ell \\left( {\\frac{\\alpha }{{nsup}},\\frac{{\\mu (t)}}{{nsup}}} \\right) } \\right\\} } \\right) $$ , if $$\\mu (t) &lt; \\alpha $$ ; and (ii) the tight upper bound of $$\\Pr [{S(t)} \\le \\alpha ]$$ is $$O\\left( {\\exp \\left\\{ { - n\\ell \\left( {\\frac{\\alpha }{{nsup}},\\frac{{\\mu (t)}}{{nsup}}} \\right) } \\right\\} } \\right) $$ , if $$\\mu (t) &gt; \\alpha $$ , where $$\\Pr [X]$$ is the probability of random event $$X,\\, S(t)$$ is the sum of the monitored area at time $$t,\\, n$$ is the number of the sensor nodes, $$sup$$ is the upper bound of sensed data, $$ \\mu (t)$$ is the expectation of $$S(t)$$ , and $$\\ell ({x_1},{x_2}) = {x_1}\\ln \\left( {\\frac{{{x_1}}}{{{x_2}}}} \\right) + (1 - {x_1})\\ln \\left( {\\frac{{1 - {x_1}}}{{1 - {x_2}}}} \\right) $$ . An instant $$(\\alpha ,\\tau )$$ -monitoring scheme is then developed based on the upper bound. Moreover, approximate continuous $$(\\alpha , \\tau )$$ -monitoring is investigated. We prove that the probability of false negative alarm is $$\\delta $$ , if the sample size is for a given precision requirement, where is the fractile of a standard normal distribution. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithms is validated through experiments.",
