    "title": "Parity and strong parity edge-colorings of graphs",
    "abstract": "A parity walk in an edge-coloring of a graph is a walk along which each color is used an even number of times. A parity edge-coloring (respectively, strong parity edge-coloring) is an edge-coloring in which there is no nontrivial parity path (respectively, open parity walk). The parity edge-chromatic number p(G) (respectively, strong parity edge-chromatic number $\\widehat{p}(G)$ ) is the least number of colors in a parity edge-coloring (respectively, strong parity edge-coloring) of G. Notice that $\\widehat{p}(G) \\ge p(G) \\ge \\chi'(G) \\ge \\Delta(G)$ for any graph G. In this paper, we determine $\\widehat{p}(G)$ and p(G) for some complete bipartite graphs and some products of graphs. For instance, we determine $\\widehat{p}(K_{m,n})$ and p(K m,n ) for m≤n with n≡0,−1,−2 (mod 2⌈lg m⌉).",
