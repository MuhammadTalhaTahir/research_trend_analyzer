    "title": "A sufficient condition for planar graphs to be (3,Â 1)-choosable",
    "abstract": "A (k,&nbsp;d)-list assignment L of a graph is a function that assigns to each vertex v a list L(v) of at least k colors satisfying $$|L(x)\\cap L(y)|\\le d$$ for each edge xy. An L-coloring is a vertex coloring $$\\pi $$ such that $$\\pi (v) \\in L(v)$$ for each vertex v and $$\\pi (x) \\ne \\pi (y)$$ for each edge xy. A graph G is (k,&nbsp;d)-choosable if there exists an L-coloring of G for every (k,&nbsp;d)-list assignment L. This concept is known as choosability with separation. In this paper, we will use Thomassen list coloring extension method to prove that planar graphs with neither 6-cycles nor adjacent 4- and 5-cycles are (3,&nbsp;1)-choosable. This is a strengthening of a result obtained by using Discharging method which says that planar graphs without 5- and 6-cycles are (3,&nbsp;1)-choosable.",
