    "title": "Minimum $$ s-t $$ hypercut in (s,Â t)-planar hypergraphs",
    "abstract": "Planar hypergraphs are widely used in several applications, including VLSI design, metro maps, information visualisation, and databases. The minimum $$ s-t $$ hypercut problem in a weighted hypergraph is to find a partition of the vertices into two nonempty sets, S and $$ \\overline{S} $$ , with $$s\\in S$$ and $$t\\in \\overline{S}$$ that minimizes the total weight of hyperedges that have at least two endpoints in two different sets. In the present study, we propose an approach that effectively solves the minimum $$ s-t $$ hypercut problem in (s,&nbsp;t)-planar hypergraphs. The method proposed demonstrates polynomial time complexity, providing a significant advancement in solving this problem. The modelling example shows that the proposed strategy is effective at obtaining balanced bipartitions in VLSI circuits.",
