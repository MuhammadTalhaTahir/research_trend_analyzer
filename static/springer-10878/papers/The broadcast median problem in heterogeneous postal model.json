    "title": "The broadcast median problem in heterogeneous postal model",
    "abstract": "We propose the problem of finding broadcast medians in heterogeneous networks. A heterogeneous network is represented by a graph G=(V,E), in which each edge has a weight that denotes the communication time between its two end vertices. The overall delay of a vertex v∈V(G), denoted as b(v,G), is the minimum sum of the communication time required to send a message from v to all vertices in G. The broadcast median problem consists of finding the set of vertices v∈V(G) with minimum overall delay b(v,G) and determining the value of b(v,G). In this paper, we consider the broadcast median problem following the heterogeneous postal model. Assuming that the underlying graph G is a general graph, we show that computing b(v,G) for an arbitrary vertex v∈V(G) is NP-hard. On the other hand, assuming that G is a tree, we propose a linear time algorithm for the broadcast median problem in heterogeneous postal model.",
