    "title": "A class of error-correcting pooling designs over complexes",
    "abstract": "As a generalization of d e -disjunct matrices and (w,r;d)-cover-free-families, the notion of (s,l) e -disjunct matrices is introduced for error-correcting pooling designs over complexes (or set pooling designs). We show that (w,r,d)-cover-free-families form a class of (s,l) e -disjunct matrices. Moreover, a decoding algorithm for pooling designs based on (s,l) e -disjunct matrices is considered.",
