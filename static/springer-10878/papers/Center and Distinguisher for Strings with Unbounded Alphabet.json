    "title": "Center and Distinguisher for Strings with Unbounded Alphabet",
    "abstract": "Consider two sets $$\\mathcal{B}$$ and $$\\mathcal{G}$$ of strings of length L with characters from an unbounded alphabet Σ, i.e., the size of Σ is not bounded by a constant and has to be taken into consideration as a parameter for input size. A closest string s* of $$\\mathcal{B}$$ is a string that minimizes the maximum of Hamming1 distance(s, s*) over all string s : s ∈ $$\\mathcal{B}$$ . In contrast, a farthest string t* from $$\\mathcal{G}$$ maximizes the minimum of Hamming distance(t*,t) over all elements t: t ∈ $$\\mathcal{G}$$ . A distinguisher of $$\\mathcal{B}$$ from $$\\mathcal{G}$$ is a string that is close to every string in $$\\mathcal{B}$$ and far away from any string in $$\\mathcal{G}$$ . We obtain polynomial time approximation schemes to settle the above problems.",
