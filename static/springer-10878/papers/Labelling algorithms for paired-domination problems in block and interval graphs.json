    "title": "Labelling algorithms for paired-domination problems in block and interval graphs",
    "abstract": "Let G=(V,E) be a graph without isolated vertices. A set S⊆V is a paired-dominating set if every vertex in V−S is adjacent to a vertex in S and the subgraph induced by S contains a perfect matching. The paired-domination problem is to determine the paired-domination number, which is the minimum cardinality of a paired-dominating set. Motivated by a mistaken algorithm given by Chen, Kang and Ng (Discrete Appl. Math. 155:2077–2086, 2007), we present two linear time algorithms to find a minimum cardinality paired-dominating set in block and interval graphs. In addition, we prove that paired-domination problem is NP-complete for bipartite graphs, chordal graphs, even for split graphs.",
