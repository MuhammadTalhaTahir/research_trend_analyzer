    "title": "2-Distance paired-dominating number of graphs",
    "abstract": "Let $$G=(V,E)$$ be a simple graph without isolated vertices. For a positive integer $$k$$ , a subset $$D$$ of $$V(G)$$ is a $$k$$ -distance paired-dominating set if each vertex in $$V\\setminus {D}$$ is within distance $$k$$ of a vertex in $$D$$ and the subgraph induced by $$D$$ contains a perfect matching. In this paper, we give some upper bounds on the 2-distance paired-dominating number in terms of the minimum and maximum degree, girth, and order.",
