    "title": "The Independence Number of Graphs with a Forbidden Cycle and Ramsey Numbers",
    "abstract": "Let k ≥ 5 be a fixed integer and let m = ⌊(k − 1)/2⌋. It is shown that the independence number of a C k-free graph is at least c 1[∑ d(v)1/(m − 1)](m − 1)/m and that, for odd k, the Ramsey number r(C k, K n) is at most c 2(n m + 1/log n)1/m , where c 1 = c 1(m) &gt; 0 and c 2 = c 2(m) &gt; 0.",
