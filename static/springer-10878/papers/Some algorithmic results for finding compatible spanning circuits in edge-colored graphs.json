    "title": "Some algorithmic results for finding compatible spanning circuits in edge-colored graphs",
    "abstract": "A compatible spanning circuit in a (not necessarily properly) edge-colored graph G is a closed trail containing all vertices of G in which any two consecutively traversed edges have distinct colors. Sufficient conditions for the existence of extremal compatible spanning circuits (i.e., compatible Hamilton cycles and Euler tours), and polynomial-time algorithms for finding compatible Euler tours have been considered in previous literature. More recently, sufficient conditions for the existence of more general compatible spanning circuits in specific edge-colored graphs have been established. In this paper, we consider the existence of (more general) compatible spanning circuits from an algorithmic perspective. We first show that determining whether an edge-colored connected graph contains a compatible spanning circuit is an NP-complete problem. Next, we describe two polynomial-time algorithms for finding compatible spanning circuits in edge-colored complete graphs. These results in some sense give partial support to a conjecture on the existence of compatible Hamilton cycles in edge-colored complete graphs due to Bollobás and Erdős from the 1970s.",
