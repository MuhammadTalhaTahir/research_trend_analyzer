    "title": "Outage Performance for IDF Relaying Mobile Cooperative Networks",
    "abstract": "Cooperative communication is a key technique in fifth generation (5G) mobile wireless networks. In this paper, we study the transmit antenna selection (TAS) in mobile cooperative networks. We derive the exact closed-form outage probability (OP) expressions for two TAS schemes. Based on the derived OP expressions, the impact of power allocation on OP performance is evaluated. Then we obtain that the Monte-Carlo simulation results and the analysis results match very well. The OP performance is affected by the power-allocation parameter.",
