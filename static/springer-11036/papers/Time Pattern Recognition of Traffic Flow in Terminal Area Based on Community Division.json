    "title": "Time Pattern Recognition of Traffic Flow in Terminal Area Based on Community Division",
    "abstract": "In order to extract the time pattern of traffic flow fluctuation in terminal area and realize the macroscopic description of traffic flow in terminal area. A time pattern recognition method of traffic flow in terminal area is proposed. Firstly, the traffic flow in the terminal area is counted, the time scale is determined according to the characteristics of data distribution, and the flow time series is established. Secondly, time series are mapped into complex networks by using visibility graph. Finally, time series segmentation and time pattern recognition are realized by community division of complex networks. Based on the experimental data of 4998 arrival flights within a week in a terminal area, the time series is established and the experiment is carried out. Experimental results show that with transformation of time series into complex networks, the dynamic segmentation of time series can be realized by community division, and the accurate identification of different fluctuation modes of time series can be realized while maintaining the dynamic segmentation of time series.",
