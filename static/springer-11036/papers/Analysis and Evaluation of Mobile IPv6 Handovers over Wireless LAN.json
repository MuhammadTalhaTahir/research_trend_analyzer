    "title": "Analysis and Evaluation of Mobile IPv6 Handovers over Wireless LAN",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the IPv6 handover over wireless LANs. Mobile IPv6 is designed to manage mobile nodes movements between wireless IPv6 networks. Nevertheless, a mobile node cannot receive IP packets on its new point of attachment until the handover completes. Therefore, a number of extensions to Mobile IPv6 have been proposed to reduce the handover latency and the number of lost packets. We focus on Fast Mobile IPv6 which is an extension of Mobile IPv6 that allows the use of L2 triggers to anticipate the handover. We compare the handover latency in four specific cases: basic Mobile IPv6, the forwarding method of Mobile IPv6, the Anticipated method, and the Tunnel-Based Handover. The results of the handover latency are calculated with the L2 properties of IEEE 802.11b. In particular, we take into account the L2 handover for different configurations of the wireless network.",
