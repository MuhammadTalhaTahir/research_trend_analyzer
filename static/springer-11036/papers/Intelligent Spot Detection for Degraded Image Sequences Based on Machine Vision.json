    "title": "Intelligent Spot Detection for Degraded Image Sequences Based on Machine Vision",
    "abstract": "Aiming at the problem that the detection process is complex, which leads to the poor detection effect of degraded image spots, an intelligent detection technology of degraded image sequence spots based on machine vision is proposed. The binary mask image is obtained through the mathematical model of degraded image spots, and the existing spots in the degraded image are detected, and the probability density of candidate spots detected in the neighborhood of the degraded image is calculated, according to the principle that the probability density of the actual candidate spots is less than that caused by noise, the problem of high false detection rate caused by defects and noise is solved. The experimental results show that the method has high accuracy, wide detection range and high signal-to-noise ratio.",
