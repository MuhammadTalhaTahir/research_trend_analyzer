    "title": "Adaptive SON and Cognitive Smart LPN for 5G Heterogeneous Networks",
    "abstract": "To overcome the challenge of large data demanding in future 5G cellular networks, heterogeneous networks (HetNets) take advantage of low power nodes (LPNs) to enhance capacity and coverage. This paper aims at 5G HetNets and presents a novel scheme of adaptive self-organization network (SON) by integrating cognitive radio (CR) with inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC). Particularly, we combine the spectrum sensing function from CR and the radio resource layering function from ICIC. Our work addresses the issues of smart low-power node (SLPN) development, which associates appropriate sectorization with radio resource allocation during the self-organization process. We further develop a Hungarian algorithm based self-organization strategy to improve the SLPN adaptive optimization. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve considerable gain in terms of throughput and coverage, with extra rewards of high flexibility and low complexity in HetNet SON.",
