    "title": "Construction of Sports Safety Information Mining Platform Based on Multimedia Data Sharing Technology",
    "abstract": "In order to improve the effect of sports information mining effectively, a sports security information mining platform based on multimedia data sharing technology is designed. The hardware part of the platform includes teaching multimedia data sharing module, sharing server module, sharing client and Web server. In order to realize the information transmission with low time delay and low energy consumption, ZigBee technology is introduced into the software design to realize the communication function of information and complete the evaluation of mining quality. The experimental results show that the time of sports information mining is obviously shortened and the application effect of the platform is improved after the application of the mining platform designed in this study.",
