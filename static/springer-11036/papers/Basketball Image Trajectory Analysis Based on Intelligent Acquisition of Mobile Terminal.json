    "title": "Basketball Image Trajectory Analysis Based on Intelligent Acquisition of Mobile Terminal",
    "abstract": "In view of the obvious deviation of traditional methods in the analysis of basketball flight state, a basketball trajectory analysis method based on intelligent image of mobile terminal is designed. Firstly, the mobile terminal network equipment is used to effectively collect the basketball trajectory. The gray pixel set of basketball image is obtained. Combined with the nonlinear transformation method, the color of basketball image is enhanced and the image quality is effectively improved. Based on this, the running process of basketball is analyzed from two aspects of initial angle and initial running speed. High quality basketball trajectory image can ensure the accuracy of initial angle and initial running speed analysis. The experimental results show that the MAE value of this method is always lower than 0.1, the F-measure value is relatively high, and the duration of trajectory analysis is between 0.72&nbsp;s and 0.81&nbsp;s, which fully proves the effectiveness and feasibility of this method.",
