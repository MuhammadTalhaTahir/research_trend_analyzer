    "title": "Exploiting Interference for Intelligent Relaying in Integrated Space and Terrestrial Networks Based on PNC and SIC",
    "abstract": "The integrated space and terrestrial networks which incorporate various satellite systems and ground networks could provide a wide variety of services and global seamless network access. The integrated network is composed of multiple heterogeneous nodes and sub-networks which requires intelligent and efficient physical layer transmission techniques to maintain high-speed links between these subsystems. As a traditional technology in satellite communications, relay could still work as an important part in these heterogeneous and complex networks. In this paper, two interference exploitation schemes, i.e., physical-layer network coding (PNC) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) which can efficiently increase data exchange rate for relay systems are studied, and an intelligent relaying scheme combining both the advantages of these two schemes is proposed. Simulation results show the proposed adaptive transmission scheme achieves a smoother sum-rate gain while being more robust to dynamic topologies.",
