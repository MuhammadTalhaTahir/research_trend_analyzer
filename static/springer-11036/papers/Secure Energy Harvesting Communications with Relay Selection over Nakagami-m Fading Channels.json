    "title": "Secure Energy Harvesting Communications with Relay Selection over Nakagami-m Fading Channels",
    "abstract": "In this paper, an energy harvesting relay network over Nakagami-m fading is investigated. In the considered system, the power beacon can provide wireless energy for the source and relays which deploy time-switching-based radio frequency energy harvesting technique. Two relay selection schemes, namely partial relay selection and optimal relay selection, are proposed in order to enhance the system performance. In the former, the source only has the channel state information of the first hop, while in the latter it has the full knowledge of the channel state information. The eavesdropper is able to wiretap to the signal transmitted from the source and the relays. The exact closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability are derived. The results show that optimal relay selection performs better than partial relay selection. With increasing number of relays, the considered system shows better performance. In addition, the energy harvesting duration has a significant effect on the secrecy outage probability.",
