    "title": "Flooding-Based Geocasting Protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks",
    "abstract": "Geocasting is a variation on the notion of multicasting. A geographical area is associated with each geocast, and the geocast is delivered to the nodes within the specified geographical area. Thus, geocasting may be used for sending a message that is likely to be of interest to everyone in a specified area. In this paper, we propose three geocasting protocols for ad hoc networks, obtained as variations of a multicast flooding algorithm, and then evaluate these approaches by means of simulations. Proposed geocasting algorithms attempt to utilize physical location information to decrease the overhead of geocast delivery.",
