    "title": "Performance of coherent MQAM schemes in the presence of frequency‐selective Rayleigh fading and CCI",
    "abstract": "Performance of a coherent MQAM system in the presence of frequency-selective Rayleigh fading, co-channel interference (CCI) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is presented. Square-root raised-cosine filters are used in both the transmitter and receiver for an optimum performance in a band-limited AWGN channel. Frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel is modeled as a two-ray model. Based on the characteristic functions of the received signals and a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) method, an analytical procedure to compute the error probability is derived. Numerical results for an illustrative example of a 16QAM system are given. Effects of CCI and frequency-selective fading on the system performance are examined. Accuracy of the proposed method is discussed in comparison with other simulation and analytical techniques.",
