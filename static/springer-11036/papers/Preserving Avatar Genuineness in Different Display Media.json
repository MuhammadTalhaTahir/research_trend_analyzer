    "title": "Preserving Avatar Genuineness in Different Display Media",
    "abstract": "Our research focuses on enabling users to interact with others using 3D avatars with the same appearance and personality in different media such as the Internet, SMS or television and using different devices such as PCs, MACs, PDAs, mobile phones and televisions. This work’s main contribution is its use of a unique architecture, tested with a contact application, which is compatible with different media. The avatar appearance editor, the animation engine and the 3D models are the same for the different media: TV, SMS and Internet chat.",
