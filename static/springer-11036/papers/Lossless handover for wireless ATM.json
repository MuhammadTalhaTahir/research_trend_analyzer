    "title": "Lossless handover for wireless ATM",
    "abstract": "Handover is one of the key research topics for the emerging wireless ATM networks. This paper describes a handover mechanism for intra-switch handovers for wireless ATM. The handover procedure is simple enough to be implementable as a limited enhancement to ATM switch platforms for fixed network, yet provides low delay and lossless handover when used together with a suitable radio interface. The paper also reports on initial simulation result.",
