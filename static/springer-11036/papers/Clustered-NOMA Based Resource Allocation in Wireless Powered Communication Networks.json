    "abstract": "Wireless Powered Communication (WPC) provides an effective solution to the contradiction between information transmission and energy consumption for Internet of Things (IoT) terminals. In this paper, a clustered-Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (C-NOMA) based WPC model is proposed. Base Station (BS) transfers Radio Frequency (RF) energy to all terminals in the downlink, while terminals transmit information to BS in the uplink by utilizing the harvested energy. A terminal clustering scheme based on maximizing the sum of channel condition difference between terminals is adopted. Specifically, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is used for inter-cluster terminals, while NOMA is used for intra-cluster terminals. In addition, a time-sharing mechanism is adopted to decode information. The sum rate in the uplink is maximized by jointly optimizing transmit power of BS, uplink and downlink subslot. Simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed C-NOMA based WPC model can not only maximize the sum rate in the uplink, but also enhance the fairness between terminals.",
