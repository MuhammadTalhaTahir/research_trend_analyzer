    "title": "Performance Improvement of the Precise Paging in Co-LAC for 2G/3G Convergence Core Networks with Path Diversity",
    "abstract": "The 2G/3G interoperability is enabled over the real networks since TDS-CDMA has been introduced. However, due to many 2G/3G borders in the same area, especially in the same location, too much extra network traffic is caused by paging signals and location updates within the 2G and 3G networks. Therefore, performance improvement of both theory and implementation becomes very important. In this paper, we firstly study the related theoretical model with network parameters. Next, some system performances metrics including handover success rate and network completion rates are evaluated by the implementation over the real systems.",
