    "title": "The Design of Web Games for Helping Young High-Functioning Autistics in Learning How to Manage Money",
    "abstract": "We describe the design of a Web-based game application aimed to support high-functioning individuals affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder in gaining skills that can help them understand the concept of money and apply it in practical life situations. In order to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the games, a user study involving six high-functioning ASD individuals in their teens and above was carried out. Preliminary results were encouraging and showed the potential advantages of such a system for training end users on practical life skills. We report on the redesign of the application that has been performed taking into account also the feedback gathered in the empirical validation. During the redesign we also added a more realistic game involving interaction with a vending machine, a tool that is commonly used by teenagers to buy snacks or drinks.",
