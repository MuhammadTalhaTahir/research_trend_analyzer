    "title": "Maximizing Network Lifetime of Broadcasting Over Wireless Stationary Ad Hoc Networks",
    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of extending the network lifetime of a single broadcast session over wireless stationary ad hoc networks where the hosts are not mobile. We define the network lifetime as the time from network initialization to the first node failure due to battery depletion. We provide through graph theoretic approaches a polynomial-time globally optimal solution, a variant of the minimum spanning tree (MST), to the problem of maximizing the static network lifetime. We make use of this solution to develop a periodic tree update strategy for effective load balancing and show that a significant gain in network lifetime over the optimal static network lifetime can be achieved. We provide extensive comparative simulation studies on parameters such as update interval and control overhead and investigate their impact on the network lifetime. The simulation results are also compared with an upper bound to the network lifetime.",
