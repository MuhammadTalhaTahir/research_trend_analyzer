    "title": "Personalized Auxiliary Information Presentation System for Mobile Network Based on Multimodal Information",
    "abstract": "The existing personalized auxiliary information presentation system has some problems, such as low presentation efficiency, poor emotion recognition effect and so on. In this paper, multimodal information is introduced to improve the personalized auxiliary information presentation system of mobile network. On the basis of obtaining user demand data, data processing was carried out through input data analysis layer and logic service layer. The multi-modal information was obtained at the perception layer and transmitted to the system service layer to realize the user multi-modal state identification of the personalized auxiliary information presentation system in the mobile network. The long-term and short-term memory network model was constructed to identify the personalized auxiliary information of mobile network, and the personalized auxiliary information of mobile network is presented according to the user's emotion. The experimental results show that the system can effectively identify the user emotion, and realize the personalized presentation of personalized auxiliary information in the mobile network according to the user emotion. At this time, the learning rate is 0.02, and the optimal length is 25 words.",
