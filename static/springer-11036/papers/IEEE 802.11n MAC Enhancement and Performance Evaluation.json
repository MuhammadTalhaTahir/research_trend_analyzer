    "abstract": "The IEEE 802.11-based WiFi wireless technology is one of the most promising technologies to provide ubiquitous networking access. The IEEE 802.11 working group has always strived to improve this wireless technology through creating new amendments to the base 802.11 standard. Recently, IEEE 802.11n amendment was created to enhance 802.11 for higher throughput operation. Not only new Physical Layer enhancements are standardized, but new Medium Access Control Layer mechanism are also defined. In this paper, we examine the network performance enhancement by the proposed 802.11n MAC layer features: aggregation, block acknowledgement, and reverse direction mechanism. We implemented a new 802.11n module in the NS-2 simulation platform. The simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of 802.11n MAC layer enhancement. VoIP performance is effectively improved with 802.11n MAC enhancement.",
