    "title": "P2P Network Based Smart Parking System Using Edge Computing",
    "abstract": "Smart parking techniques are widely used in smart city and intelligent transportation systems. However, how to build a friendly and effective smart parking system in a large city is still a challenge. This paper proposes a P2P network based smart parking system using Edge Computing. It utilizes Cloud Computing, Edge Computing, and P2P network techniques to provide plenty of services including parking space inquiry, navigation, vehicle license plate recognition, payment, and accident query. The architecture of the system and the related protocols and algorithms are presented in detail. Compared with the existing smart parking systems, the proposed system is more friendly and effective.",
