    "title": "Outage Performance of Energy Harvesting DF Relaying NOMA Networks",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate energy harvesting decode-and-forward relaying non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. We study two cases of single relay and multiple relays with partial relay selection strategy. Specifically, one source node wishes to transmit two symbols to two respective destinations directly and via the help of one selected intermediate energy constraint relay node, and the NOMA technique is applied in the transmission of both hops (from source to relay and from relay to destinations). For performance evaluation, we derive the closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) at D 1 and D 2 with both cases of single and multiple relays. Our analysis is substantiated via Monte Carlo simulation. The effect of several parameters, such as power allocation factors in both transmissions in two hops, power splitting ratio, energy harvesting efficiency, and the location of relay nodes to the outage performances at the two destinations is investigated.",
