    "title": "A Fine-Grained Attribute Based Data Retrieval with Proxy Re-Encryption Scheme for Data Outsourcing Systems",
    "abstract": "Attribute based encryption is suitable for data protection in data outsourcing systems such as cloud computing. However, the leveraging of encryption technique may retrain some routine operations over the encrypted data, particularly in the field of data retrieval. This paper presents an attribute based date retrieval with proxy re-encryption (ABDR-PRE) to provide both fine-grained access control and retrieval over the ciphertexts. The proposed scheme achieves fine-grained data access management by adopting KP-ABE mechanism, a delegator can generate the re-encryption key and search indexes for the ciphertexts to be shared over the target delegateeâ€™s attributes. Throughout the process of data sharing, the data are transferred as ciphers thus the server and unauthorized users cannot acquire the sensitive information of the encrypted data so the privacy and confidentiality can be protected. By security analysis, the proposed scheme meets the security requirements confidentiality, keyword semantic security as well as collusion attack resistance.",
