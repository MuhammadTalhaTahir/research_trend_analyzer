    "title": "Performance Evaluation of a Power Management Scheme for Disruption Tolerant Network",
    "abstract": "Disruption tolerant network (DTN) is characterized by frequent partitions and intermittent connectivity. Power management issue in such networks is challenging. Existing power management schemes for wireless networks cannot be directly applied to DTNs because they assume the networks are well-connected. Since the network connectivity opportunities are rare, any power management scheme deployed in DTNs should not worsen the existing network connectivity. In this paper, we design a power management scheme called context-aware power management scheme (CAPM) for DTNs. Our CAPM scheme has an adaptive on period feature that allows it to achieve high delivery ratio and low delivery latency when used with Prophet, a recently proposed DTN routing scheme. Via simulations, we evaluate the performance of the CAPM scheme when used with the Prophet routing scheme in different scenarios e.g. different traffic load, node speeds and sleep patterns. Our evaluation results indicate that the CAPM scheme is very promising in providing energy saving (as high as 80%) without degrading much the data delivery performance.",
