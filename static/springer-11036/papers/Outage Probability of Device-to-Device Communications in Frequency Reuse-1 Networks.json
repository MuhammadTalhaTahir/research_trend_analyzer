    "title": "Outage Probability of Device-to-Device Communications in Frequency Reuse-1 Networks",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyse the outage probability of Device-to-Device (D2D) communications in a multi-cell frequency reuse-1 (FRF-1) system. We derive a formula for outage probability of a D2D link in the FRF-1 system when uplink resource sharing between cellular users and D2D users is enabled in the network. Based on this analysis, we propose a location-based power control mechanism for D2D which can enhance the outage performance of the D2D link, and at the same time, reduce the transmit power required for communication.",
