    "title": "Towards Designing a Trusted Routing Solution in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks",
    "abstract": "Designing a trusted and secure routing solution in an untrustworthy scenario is always a challenging problem. Lack of physical security and low trust levels among nodes in an ad hoc network demands a secure end-to-end route free of any malicious entity. This is particularly challenging when malicious nodes collude with one another to disrupt the network operation. In this paper we have designed a secure routing solution to find an end-to-end route free of malicious nodes with collaborative effort from the neighbors. We have also extended the solution to secure the network against colluding malicious nodes, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first such solution proposed. We have also proposed a framework for computing and distributing trusts that can be used with out trusted routing protocol. Our proposed framework is unique and different from the other schemes in that it tries to analyze the psychology of the attacker and quantifies the behavior in the computational model. Extensive simulation has been carried out to evaluate the design of our protocol.",
