    "title": "A comprehensive review of firefly algorithms",
    "abstract": "The  firefly algorithm  has become an increasingly important tool of  Swarm Intelligence  that has been applied in almost all areas of optimization, as well as engineering practice. Many problems from various areas have been successfully solved using the  firefly algorithm  and its variants. In order to use the algorithm to solve diverse problems, the original firefly algorithm needs to be modified or hybridized. This paper carries out a comprehensive review of this living and evolving discipline of  Swarm Intelligence , in order to show that the firefly algorithm could be applied to every problem arising in practice. On the other hand, it encourages new researchers and algorithm developers to use this simple and yet very efficient algorithm for problem solving. It often guarantees that the obtained results will meet the expectations.",
