    "title": "Population-based metaheuristics for continuous boundary-constrained dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems",
    "abstract": "Most real-world  optimisation problems  are dynamic in nature with more than one objective, where at least two of these objectives are in conflict with one another. This kind of problems is referred to as dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems (DMOOPs). Most research in multi-objective optimisation (MOO) have focussed on static MOO (SMOO) and dynamic single-objective optimisation. However, in recent years, algorithms were proposed to solve dynamic MOO (DMOO). This paper provides an overview of the algorithms that were proposed in the literature to solve DMOOPs. In addition, challenges, practical aspects and possible future research directions of DMOO are discussed.",
