    "title": "A finite horizon deteriorating inventory model with two-phase pricing and time-varying demand and cost under trade credit financing using particle swarm optimization",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a deterministic economic order quantity model with generalized type demand, deterioration and unit purchase cost functions under two levels of trade  credit policy . Our objective is to find the optimal values of selling prices,  replenishment  number and replenishment scheme which maximize the total profit over the finite planning horizon. We establish the inventory system and provide structural properties of the optimal solution that facilitate computation. A particle swarm optimization with constriction factor is coded and used to solve the mixed-integer  nonlinear programming  problem by employing the properties derived from this paper. At the end, some numerical examples are used to illustrate the features of the proposed model.",
