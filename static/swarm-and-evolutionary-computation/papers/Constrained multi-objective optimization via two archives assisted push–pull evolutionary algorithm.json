    "title": "Constrained multi-objective optimization via two archives assisted push–pull evolutionary algorithm",
    "abstract": "Solving constrained multi-objective  optimization problems  (CMOPs) obtained more and more popularity in the last decade. Various constrained multi-objective optimization  evolutionary algorithms  were developed for the CMOPs. However, most of them are ineffective in dealing with CMOPs with complex infeasible regions. In this paper, the two archives assisted push–pull evolutionary algorithm (namely PPTA) is proposed to handle the CMOPs with complex infeasible regions effectively. PPTA has the following features: (i) Two archives ( A  and  B ) are used, where  A  is used in the push stage to promote convergence and diversity, and in the pull stage to explore undetected  feasible regions ; in the pull stage  B  is used for the promotion of convergence, diversity, and feasibility. (ii) A new push stage strategy is devised for better approximating the unconstrained  Pareto front , as well as the constrained Pareto front. (iii) The aggregation function in the pull stage is improved to better explore the  objective space . (iv) a new  ɛ -constrained method is customized to enhance the ability to explore  feasible regions . Results on 33 widely used instances and eight real-world problems verify the superiority of PPTA over 10 related methods.",
