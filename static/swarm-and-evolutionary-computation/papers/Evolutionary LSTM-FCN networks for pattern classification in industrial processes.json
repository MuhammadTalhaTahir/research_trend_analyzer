    "title": "Evolutionary LSTM-FCN networks for pattern classification in industrial processes",
    "abstract": "The  Industry 4.0  revolution allows gathering big amounts of data that are used to train and deploy  Artificial Intelligence  algorithms to solve complex industrial problems, optimally and automatically. From those, Long-Short Term Memory Fully  Convolutional Network  (LSTM-FCN) networks are gaining a lot of attention over the last decade due to their capability of successfully modeling  nonlinear feature  interactions. However, they have not been yet fully applied for pattern  classification tasks  in  time series data  within the digital industry. In this paper, a novel approach based on an  evolutionary algorithm  for optimizing the networks hyperparameters and on the resulting  deep learning  model for pattern classification is proposed. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this method, a test scenario that involves a process related to blind  fastener  installation in the  aeronautical industry  is provided. The results achieved with the proposed approach are compared with shallow models and it is demonstrated that the proposed method obtains better results with an accuracy value of 95%.",
