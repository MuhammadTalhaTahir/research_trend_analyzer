    "title": "Benchmarking evolutionary algorithms for single objective real-valued constrained optimization â€“ A critical review",
    "abstract": "Benchmarking plays an important role in the development of novel search algorithms as well as for the assessment and comparison of contemporary algorithmic ideas. This paper presents common principles that need to be taken into account when considering benchmarking problems for  constrained optimization . Current benchmark environments for testing  Evolutionary Algorithms  are reviewed in the light of these principles. Along with this line, the reader is provided with an overview of the available problem domains in the field of constrained benchmarking. Hence, the review supports algorithms developers with information about the merits and demerits of the available frameworks.",
