    "title": "Bi-objective scheduling of physical therapy treatments with coupled operations for inpatients in rehabilitation departments",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the field of physical therapy has experienced significant growth, particularly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the capacity of rehabilitation services remains inadequate. This current study deals with scheduling physical therapies with coupled operations and multiple resources in rehabilitation departments, considering bi-objective optimization by minimizing both makespan and waiting time. Based on detailed analysis of practical operations, a  mixed integer linear programming model  is formulated. For small-size instances, optimal solutions can be obtained using software such as Gurobi. To handle large instances, a compound NSGA-II algorithm (CNSGA-II) is proposed. CNSGA-II consists of First-NSGA-II and Second-NSGA-II, which are associated with patient sequences and their respective treatments. Furthermore, practical heuristics are used to improve the initial solutions for CNSGA-II. The results of a real-work instance show that makespan is reduced by approximately 8.0%–10.8% and the maximum waiting time is reduced by about 26.4%–30.0%, comparing to the Queue Length Priority Algorithm commonly used in practice. The proposed CNSGA-II is further assessed using randomly generated instances and compared to MOEA/D and NSGA-II based on HV and IGD metrics. The results indicate the superior performance and effectiveness of the proposed CNSGA-II algorithm.",
