    "title": "Quantum-enhanced multiobjective large-scale optimization via parallelism",
    "abstract": "Traditional quantum-based  evolutionary algorithms  are intended to solve single-objective  optimization problems  or multiobjective small-scale optimization problems. However, multiobjective large-scale optimization problems are continuously emerging in the big-data era. Therefore, the research in this paper, which focuses on combining  quantum mechanics  with multiobjective large-scale  optimization algorithms , will be beneficial to the study of quantum-based  evolutionary algorithms . In traditional quantum-behaved  particle swarm optimization  (QPSO), particle position uncertainty prevents the algorithm from easily falling into local optima. Inspired by the uncertainty principle of position, the authors propose quantum-enhanced multiobjective large-scale algorithms, which are parallel multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithms (PMLEAs). Specifically, PMLEA-QDE, PMLEA-QjDE and PMLEA-QJADE are proposed by introducing the search mechanism of the individual particle from QPSO into differential evolution (DE), differential evolution with self-adapting  control parameters  (jDE) and adaptive differential evolution with optional  external archive  (JADE). Moreover, the proposed algorithms are implemented with  parallelism  to improve the optimization efficiency. Verifications performed on several test suites indicate that the proposed quantum-enhanced algorithms are superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.",
