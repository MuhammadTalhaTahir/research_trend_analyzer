    "title": "Chaos driven discrete artificial bee algorithm for location and assignment optimisation problems",
    "abstract": "The chaos driven discrete artificial bee colony (CDABC) algorithm is introduced in this paper. Four unique chaos maps of Burgers, Lozi, Delayed Logistic and Tinkerbell are embedded as chaos pseudo-random number generators and compared with the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator. Two unique problems of quadratic assignment and capacitated  vehicle routing problem  are solved using five different variants of the algorithm and analytical comparison is conducted. Furthermore, paired  t -test is done pairwise on all variants, and from these results it is ascertained that the Tinkerbell variant of CDABC is the best performing for both problem classes.",
