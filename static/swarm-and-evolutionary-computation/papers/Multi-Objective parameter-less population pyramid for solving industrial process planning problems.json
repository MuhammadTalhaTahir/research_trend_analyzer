    "title": "Multi-Objective parameter-less population pyramid for solving industrial process planning problems",
    "abstract": "Evolutionary methods are effective tools for obtaining high-quality results when solving hard practical problems. Linkage learning may increase their effectiveness. One of the state-of-the-art methods that employ linkage learning is the Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3). P3 is dedicated to solving single-objective problems in discrete domains. Recent research shows that P3 is highly competitive when addressing problems with so-called overlapping blocks, which are typical for practical problems. In this paper, we consider a multi-objective industrial process planning problem that arises from practice and is NP-hard. To handle it, we propose a multi-objective version of P3. The extensive research shows that our  proposition  outperforms the competing methods for the considered practical problem and typical multi-objective benchmarks.",
