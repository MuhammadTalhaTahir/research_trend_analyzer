    "title": "Jointly optimizing microgrid configuration and energy consumption scheduling of smart homes",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we formulate  joint  optimization of  microgrid  configuration and energy consumption scheduling as a leader-follower Stackelberg game to model the coordination between two rational  decision makers  of microgrid configuration and energy consumption scheduling. The microgrid configuration decision, as the leader, is modeled as an upper-level optimization problem for optimal installed numbers of  wind turbines ,  photovoltaic  (PV) units, micro-turbines and  batteries . The energy consumption scheduling, as the follower, is modeled as a lower-level optimization problem, which responds to decisions of the upper level in order to determine the optimal appliance scheduling. A bi-level nonlinear programming model is formulated for the Stackelberg game. To solve this optimization model, four bi-level hierarchical algorithms with the combination of different evolutionary algorithms are implemented and compared. A case study of microgrid configuration of  smart building  is employed to demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed game-theoretic model.",
