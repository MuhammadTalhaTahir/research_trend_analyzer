    "title": "Distance based parameter adaptation for Success-History based Differential Evolution",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a simple, yet effective, modification to scaling factor and crossover rate adaptation in Success-History based Adaptive Differential Evolution (SHADE), which can be used as a framework to all SHADE-based algorithms. The performance impact of the proposed method is shown on the real-parameter single objective optimization (CEC2015 and CEC2017) benchmark sets in 10, 30, 50, and 100 dimensions for all SHADE, L-SHADE (SHADE with linear decrease of population size), and jSO algorithms. The proposed distance based parameter adaptation is designed to address the premature convergence of SHADEâ€“based algorithms in higher dimensional search spaces to maintain a longer exploration phase. This design effectiveness is supported by presenting a population clustering analysis, along with a population diversity measure. Also, the new distance based algorithm versions (Db_SHADE, DbL_SHADE, and DISH) have obtained significantly better optimization results than their canonical counterparts (SHADE, L_SHADE, and jSO) in 30, 50, and 100 dimensional functions.",
