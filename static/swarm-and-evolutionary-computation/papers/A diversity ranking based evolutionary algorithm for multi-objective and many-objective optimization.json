    "title": "A diversity ranking based evolutionary algorithm for multi-objective and many-objective optimization",
    "abstract": "In recent years, a variety of multi-objective  evolutionary algorithms  (MOEAs) have been proposed in the literature. As pointed out in some recent studies, the performance of most existing MOEAs is sensitive to the  Pareto front  (PF) shapes of the problem to be solved, and it is difficult for these algorithms to manage diversity on various types of Pareto fronts (PFs) effectively. To address these issues, this paper proposes an  evolutionary algorithm  based on diversity ranking method for multi-objective and many-objective optimization. The proposed evolutionary algorithm introduces reference vector adaptation method to solve different shapes of Pareto fronts, and proposes the diversity ranking method to manage diversity. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can solve various types of Pareto fronts, surpassing several state-of-the-art  evolutionary algorithms  for multi-objective and many-objective optimization.",
