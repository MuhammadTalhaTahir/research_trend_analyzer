    "title": "A particle swarm optimization-based deep clustering algorithm for power load curve analysis",
    "abstract": "To address the inflexibility of the convolutional  autoencoder  (CAE) in adjusting the network structure and the difficulty of accurately delineating complex class boundaries in power load data, a  particle swarm optimization  deep clustering method (DC-PSO) is proposed. First, a  particle swarm optimization  algorithm for automatically searching the optimal network architecture and hyperparameters of CAE (AHPSO) is proposed to obtain better reconstruction performance. Then, an end-to-end deep clustering model based on a reliable sample selection strategy is designed for the deep  clustering algorithm  to accurately delineate the category boundaries and further improve the clustering effect. The experimental results show that the DC-PSO algorithm exhibits high clustering accuracy and higher performance for the power load profile clustering.",
