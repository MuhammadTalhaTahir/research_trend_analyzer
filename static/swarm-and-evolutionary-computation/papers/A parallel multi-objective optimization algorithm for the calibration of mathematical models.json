    "title": "A parallel multi-objective optimization algorithm for the calibration of mathematical models",
    "abstract": "Based on evolutionary computation techniques, we present a parallel, globally convergent, multi-objective optimization algorithm which extends the  Covariance Matrix  Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES). This approach enables identifying multiple global optima and multiple discontinuous  Pareto set  solutions of the optimization problem in a compact  search space . After evaluating the algorithm with test functions, we apply our method to the identification of the parameters of a reaction–diffusion model of a  genetic  regulatory mechanism during  Drosophila  early development, our simulations being in agreement with the experimental data. Comparisons with a multi-objective version of the CMA-ES (MO-CMA-ES) on this dataset show that our algorithm outperforms largely the speed of convergence of MO-CMA-ES. We have identified an infinite number of accurate solutions of the model equations, associated with the Pareto set of the optimization problem. This non-unicity property of a biological developmental process explains  phenotypic plasticity  and resilience in biological systems.",
