    "title": "Reinforcement learning for enhanced online gradient-based parameter adaptation in metaheuristics",
    "abstract": "Parameter setting is a significant and demanding process in metaheuristics. It requires deep understanding of the considered algorithm as well as of the considered optimization problem. Thus, it has attracted ongoing scientific interest counting a considerable number of relevant approaches, which are mostly focused in offline and  ad hoc  procedures. Interestingly, the parameter tuners contain also their own parameters. It is a basic requirement that these parameters shall be easily tunable and mildly affecting the tuner’s performance. The present work proposes an enhanced version of the recently proposed gradient-based parameter adaptation method, which offers an online general-purpose parameter tuning procedure that is applicable to any metaheuristic. The proposed method dynamically tunes the tuner’s parameters by using the REINFORCE reinforcement  learning paradigm . The method is demonstrated on the differential evolution algorithm for established test suites of variable dimensions as well as for the real-world application of detecting  atomic clusters  through the minimization of Lennard-Jones potentials. The obtained results are statistically analyzed and compared with state-of-the-art auto-tuning algorithms. The analysis reveals the promising performance of the proposed approach as well as its robustness under the considered experimental setting.",
