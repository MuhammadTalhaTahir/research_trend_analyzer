    "title": "Characterization of rankings generated by pseudo-Boolean functions",
    "abstract": "In this paper we pursue the study of pseudo-Boolean functions as ranking generators. The objective of the work is to find new insights between the relation of the degree  m  of a pseudo-Boolean function and the rankings that can be generated by these insights. Based on a characterization theorem for pseudo-Boolean functions of degree  m , several observations are made. First, we verify that pseudo-Boolean functions of degree  m < n , where  n  is the search space dimension, cannot generate all the possible rankings of the solutions. Secondly, the sufficient condition for a ranking to be generated by a pseudo-Boolean function of dimension  ( n − 1 )  is presented, and also the necessary condition is conjectured. Finally, we observe that the same argument is not sufficient to prove which ranking can be generated by pseudo-Boolean functions of degree  m < n − 1 .",
