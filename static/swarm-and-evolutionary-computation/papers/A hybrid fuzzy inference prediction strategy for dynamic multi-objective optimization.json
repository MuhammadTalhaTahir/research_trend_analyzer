    "title": "A hybrid fuzzy inference prediction strategy for dynamic multi-objective optimization",
    "abstract": "Many real-world multi-objective  optimization problems  (MOPs) are dynamic in which variables of  search space  and/or  objective space  change over time. Hence the  optimization algorithms  should can quickly and efficiently track the  Pareto front  in dealing with dynamic environments. In this paper, a hybrid population prediction strategy based on fuzzy inference and one-step prediction (FIOPPS) is presented to extrapolate ahead the trajectory (position and/or orientation) of the new  Pareto optimal solution  set from the previous  Pareto optimal  solution sets and ensure the algorithm to respond quickly and effectively when the environment changes thus tracking the changing Pareto front. In our algorithm, the fuzzy inference model based on the  Maximum Entropy  Principle is extracted automatically from the previously found  Pareto optimal solution  sets to predict the  Pareto solution  sets at the beginning of the next time. Moreover, a new one-step prediction model is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy for environmental changes from  motion  state to static state and vice versa. Furthermore, a new variant of teaching–learning-based optimization algorithm with decomposition is first proposed as the  MOEA  optimizer for solving dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs). In the proposed MOTLBO/D variant, the multi-objective  decomposition mechanism  is adopted and neighbor strategy is introduced into teaching–learning-based optimization algorithm (TLBO) to maintain the diversity of population and avoid the algorithm trapping into the  local areas . Finally, to verify the performance of the proposed methods, ten benchmark test functions are simulated and evaluated. The statistical results indicate that the proposed FIOPPS strategy is promising for dealing with DMOPs.",
