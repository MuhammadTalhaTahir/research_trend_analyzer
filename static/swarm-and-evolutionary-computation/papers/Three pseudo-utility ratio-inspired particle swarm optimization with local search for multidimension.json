    "title": "Three pseudo-utility ratio-inspired particle swarm optimization with local search for multidimensional knapsack problem",
    "abstract": "In this study, a three-ratio self-adaptive check and repair operator-inspired  particle swarm optimization  (3R-SACRO-PSO) with  neighborhood local  search is developed to solve the multidimensional  knapsack problem  (MKP). The proposed 3R-SACRO-PSO systematically alters substitute pseudo-utility ratios as the PSO method is executed. In addition, a local search scheme is introduced to improve solution quality. The proposed 3R-SACRO-PSO algorithm is tested using 168 different widely used benchmarks from the OR-Library to demonstrate and validate its performance. The  control parameters  for the  performance test  are determined through the  Taguchi method . Experimental results parallel those of other PSO algorithms, and statistical test results show that the quality and efficiency of the proposed 3R-SACRO are better than those of the two-ratio SACRO method. Moreover, the proposed 3R-SACRO-PSO is on par with state-of-the-art PSO approaches. Thus, introducing the third pseudo-utility ratio into SACRO improves the performance of SACRO-based PSO. The neighborhood local search scheme further improves the solution quality in handling MKPs.",
