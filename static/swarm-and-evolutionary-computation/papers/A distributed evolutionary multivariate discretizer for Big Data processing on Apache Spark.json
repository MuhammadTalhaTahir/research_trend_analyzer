    "title": "A distributed evolutionary multivariate discretizer for Big Data processing on Apache Spark",
    "abstract": "Nowadays the phenomenon of  Big Data  is overwhelming our capacity to extract relevant knowledge through classical  machine learning techniques .  Discretization  (as part of data reduction) is presented as a real solution to reduce this complexity. However, standard discretizers are not designed to perform well with such amounts of data. This paper proposes a distributed discretization algorithm for Big  Data analytics  based on evolutionary optimization. After comparing with a distributed discretizer based on the Minimum Description Length Principle, we have found that our solution yields more accurate and simpler solutions in reasonable time.",
