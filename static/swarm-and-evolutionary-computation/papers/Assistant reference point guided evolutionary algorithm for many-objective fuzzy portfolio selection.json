    "title": "Assistant reference point guided evolutionary algorithm for many-objective fuzzy portfolio selection",
    "abstract": "Portfolio selection is dedicated to assigning limited capital to available financial assets to achieve an optimal trade-off between profit and risk. This work is targeted at a portfolio selection problem simultaneously considering five optimization objectives namely mean, variance, skewness,  kurtosis , and entropy of return. An expertâ€™s acknowledge-based fuzzy number variable, rather than a  random variable , is used to model the return of a risk asset, such that a more accurate estimation of the return of a risky asset is achieved. An assistant  reference point  guided evolutionary algorithm (ARPGEA) is proposed to solve this five-objective portfolio problem. Assistant reference points are generated for the non-dominated solutions in all dimensions of the objective space. The generated reference points and a comprehensive fitness evaluation method are used to guide the search towards promising regions leading to well-distributed and well-converged solutions. ARPGEA is tested on publicly available data sets collected from six market indices including up to 1,203 assets. Experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of ARPGEA in comparison with other five state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms.",
