    "abstract": "Autonomous and interactive healthcare applications exist for providing patients with customized services through user equipment (UE). For user interaction, these applications take the form of  chatbots  or physical robots. A user's request/query is fed as input for fetching and delivering user services. Due to the wide range of connectivity and application services, heavy data traffic can deteriorate the quality of application service. This paper proposes a relative traffic management scheme (RTMS) to address traffic issues in applications involving delicate  healthcare data . The proposed scheme uses healthcare data flow and  query processing  to improve the responsiveness of autonomous robot-based services. Dilated traffic at any interconnecting edge is identified based on flow concentration; for this purpose,  ant colony optimization  (ACO) is used. The premature convergence issue in ACO is addressed by using a linear  sigmoid function , which identifies the converging points based on the query processing factor to reinitiate the application service discovery and responsive deliveries. This helps to reduce both outages in healthcare  service provisioning  and processing time. It additionally improves response with controlled processing complexity.",
