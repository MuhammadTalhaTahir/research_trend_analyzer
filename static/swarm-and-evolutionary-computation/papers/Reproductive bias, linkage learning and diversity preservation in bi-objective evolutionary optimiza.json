    "title": "Reproductive bias, linkage learning and diversity preservation in bi-objective evolutionary optimization",
    "abstract": "Diversity preservation is a crucial component for any  multiobjective evolutionary algorithm , and its effectiveness defines how well an algorithm can find solutions to cover the whole extension of the Pareto-optimal front. In this paper, we show that traditional reproduction operators such as  p -uniform and  n -point crossover may sabotage the functioning of diversity preservation mechanisms by producing more solutions in some areas of the objective-space than in others, i.e., they are biased. We argue that such reproductive bias is due to their high degree of disruptiveness which favors the generation of  average quality   offspring . Additionally, we demonstrated the impact of linkage learning in decreasing disruptiveness and reproductive bias. Such a result helps to understand the benefits of  estimation of distribution algorithms  in bi-objective optimization. We performed experiments on instances of the  œÅMNK -model, in which the use of unbiased reproduction operators was shown to work in synergy with diversity preservation mechanisms favoring the diversity of the Pareto-fronts obtained.",
