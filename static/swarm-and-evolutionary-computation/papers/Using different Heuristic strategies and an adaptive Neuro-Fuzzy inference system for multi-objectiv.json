    "title": "Using different Heuristic strategies and an adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy inference system for multi-objective optimization of Hybrid Nanofluid to provide an efficient thermal behavior",
    "abstract": "The importance of multi-objective optimization in  hybrid nanofluid  research lies in its wide-ranging applications across fields such as microelectronics, aerospace, and  renewable energy . These specialized fluids hold the potential to elevate the performance and efficiency of diverse systems through enhanced heat transfer capabilities. This research endeavor is centered around optimizing a  hybrid nanofluid  composed of  Silicon  Oxide-MWCNT-Alumina/Water by leveraging a mix of heuristic approaches and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. To this end, the most influential set of input parameters has been identified using four state-of-the-art algorithms: Non-dominated Genetic Algorithm, multi-objective  particle swarm optimization ,  Strength  Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, and Pareto Envelope-based  Selection Algorithm  2. The goal of the optimization process is to modify the temperature ( T  = 20 °C to 60 °C) and the volume fraction of  nanoparticles  (SVF=0.1 % to 0.5 %). Finding the optimal combination of these parameters that results in the hybrid nanofluid with the maximum  thermal conductivity  (k nf ) and the lowest  dynamic viscosity  is the main objective. The findings of this research have the potential to drastically improve the performance of systems in a variety of applications and to change the creation of sophisticated, high-efficiency  heat transfer fluids .",
