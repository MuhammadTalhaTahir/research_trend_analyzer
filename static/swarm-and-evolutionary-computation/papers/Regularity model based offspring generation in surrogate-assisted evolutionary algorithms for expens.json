    "title": "Regularity model based offspring generation in surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms for expensive multi-objective optimization",
    "abstract": "Evolutionary algorithms  face significant challenges when it comes to solving expensive multi-objective  optimization problems , which require costly evaluations. One of the most popular approaches to addressing this issue is to use  surrogate models , which can replace the expensive real  function evaluations  with cheaper  approximations . However, in many surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs), the process of  offspring  generation has not received sufficient attention. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for expensive multi-objective optimization called RM-SAEA, which utilizes a regularity model (RM) operator to generate offspring more effectively. The regularity model operator is combined with a general  genetic algorithm  operator to create a heterogeneous offspring generation module that can better approximate the  Pareto front . Moreover, to overcome the data deficiency issue in expensive optimization scenarios, we employ a  data augmentation  strategy while training the regularity model. Finally, we embed three representative SAEAs into the proposed RM-SAEA to demonstrate its efficacy. Experimental results on several benchmark test suites with up to 10 objectives and real-world applications show that RM-SAEA achieves superior overall performance compared to eight state-of-the-art algorithms. By focusing on more effective offspring generation and addressing data deficiencies, our proposed framework is able to generate better approximations of the Pareto front and improve the optimization process in expensive multi-objective optimization scenarios.",
