    "title": "A constraint handling technique for constrained multi-objective genetic algorithm",
    "abstract": "A new constraint handling technique for multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed in this paper. There are two important issues in multi-objective genetic algorithm, closeness of the obtained solutions to the real  Pareto frontier  and diversity of the obtained solutions. If considering a constrained multi-objective programming problem, one needs to take account of feasibility of solutions. Thus, in this new constraint handling technique, we systematically take closeness, diversity and feasibility as three objectives in a multi-objective  subproblem . And solutions in each iteration are sorted by optimal sequence method based on those three objectives. Then, the solutions inherited to the next generation are selected based on its optimal order. Numerical tests show that the solutions obtained by this method are not only feasible, but also close to the real  Pareto front  and have good diversity.",
