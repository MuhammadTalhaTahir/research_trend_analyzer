    "title": "Deep reinforcement learning driven trajectory-based meta-heuristic for distributed heterogeneous flexible job shop scheduling problem",
    "abstract": "As the production environment evolves, distributed manufacturing exhibits heterogeneous characteristics, including diverse machines, workers, and production processes. This paper examines a distributed heterogeneous flexible job shop scheduling problem (DHFJSP) with varying processing times. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model of the DHFJSP is formulated with the objective of minimizing the makespan. To solve the DHFJSP, we propose a deep Q network-aided automatic design of a variable neighborhood search algorithm (DQN-VNS). By analyzing schedules, sixty-one types of scheduling features are extracted. These features, along with six shaking strategies, are used as states and actions. A DHFJSP environment simulator is developed to train the deep Q network. The well-trained DQN then generates the shaking procedure for VNS. Additionally, a greedy initialization method is proposed to enhance the quality of the initial solution. Seven efficient critical path-based neighborhood structures with three-vector encoding scheme are introduced to improve local search. Numerical experiments on various scales of instances validate the effectiveness of the MILP model and the DQN-VNS algorithm. The results show that the DQN-VNS algorithm achieves an average relative percentage deviation (ARPD) of 3.2%, which represents an approximately 88.45% reduction compared to the best-performing algorithm among the six compared, with an ARPD of 27.7%. This significant reduction in ARPD highlights the superior stability and performance of the proposed DQN-VNS algorithm.",
