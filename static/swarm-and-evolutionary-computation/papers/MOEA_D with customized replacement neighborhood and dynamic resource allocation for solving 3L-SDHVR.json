    "title": "MOEA/D with customized replacement neighborhood and dynamic resource allocation for solving 3L-SDHVRP",
    "abstract": "Split delivery heterogeneous  vehicle routing problem  with three-dimensional loading (3L-SDHVRP) is a critical issue in manufacturing logistics. Current mainstream research formulates this problem as a  single objective optimization problem , which fails to reveal the relationship among multiple conflicting objectives and cannot provide various trade-off solutions for decision-makers in real-world logistics scenarios. This paper concentrates on a multi-objective 3L-SDHVRP and proposes a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with customized replacement neighborhood and dynamic  resource allocation  (called MOEA/D-RD) to deal with it. The numerical experiments on the dataset from the 11th International Conference on Evolutionary Multi-Criterion Optimization (EMO 2021) show the superior performance of the proposed method over some state-of-the-art ones. The  source code  of MOEA/D-RD is available at  https://github.com/CIAM-Group/EvolutionaryAlgorithm_Codes/tree/main/MOEAD-RD .",
