    "title": "Attraction–Repulsion Optimization Algorithm for Global Optimization Problems",
    "abstract": "In this study, a novel meta-heuristic search (MHS) algorithm for constrained global optimization problems is proposed. Since many algorithms aim to achieve well-balanced exploitation–exploration stages with often unsatisfactory results, in the approach introduced in this paper, Attraction–Repulsion Optimization Algorithm (AROA), the balance associated with attraction–repulsion phenomena that occur in nature is mimicked. AROA introduces a search strategy in which a candidate solution is moved in the search space depending on the quality of solutions in its neighborhood, as well as the best candidate. The candidates are managed by local search operators based on modified Brownian motion, trigonometric functions, randomly selected solutions, and a form of memory. Consequently, AROA exhibits a satisfactory exploitation–exploration balance exhibited by highly competitive performance. The introduced algorithm is experimentally compared with the state-of-the-art meta-heuristics on the CEC 2014, 2017, and 2020 test suites. The obtained results reveal the advantages of AROA over related algorithms and its suitability in solving complex real-world problems.",
