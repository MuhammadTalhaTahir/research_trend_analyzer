    "title": "Optimal test sequence generation using firefly algorithm",
    "abstract": "Software testing is an important but complex part of  software development life cycle . The optimization of the software testing process is a major challenge, and the generation of the independent test paths remains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we present an approach based on  metaheuristic   firefly algorithm  to generate optimal test paths. In order to optimize the test case paths, we use a modified  firefly algorithm  by defining appropriate objective function and introducing guidance matrix in traversing the graph. Our simulations and comparison show that the test paths generated are critical and optimal paths.",
