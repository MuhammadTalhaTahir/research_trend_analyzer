    "title": "Two-level imperialist competitive algorithm for energy-efficient hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with relative importance of objectives",
    "abstract": "Energy-efficient hybrid  flow shop scheduling  problem (EHFSP) has been investigated in recent years; however, the relative importance of objectives is seldom considered in the previous works. In this study, EHFSP with total tardiness, makespan and total energy consumption is addressed, in which the third objective has lower importance than other ones. A new Pareto dominance is defined to deal with the relative importance and a two-level imperialist competitive algorithm (TICA) is presented, in which two levels consist of the strongest empire and other empires, respectively. To generate high quality solutions, assimilation and revolution are executed differently in empires in the different search stages, the strongest empire is excluded from imperialist competition, memory is often combined with the strongest empire and a member of memory is added into the winning empire to avoid the inclusion of the weakest colony of the weakest empire. Extensive experiments are conducted and the computational results show that TICA provides promising results for the considered EHFSP.",
