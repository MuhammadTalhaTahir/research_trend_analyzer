    "title": "Adaptive population extremal optimization-based PID neural network for multivariable nonlinear control systems",
    "abstract": "The connection weights parameters play important roles in adjusting the performance of PID  neural network  (PIDNN) for complex control systems. However, how to obtain an optimal set of  initial values  of these connection weight parameters in a multivariable PIDNN called MPIDNN is still an open issue for system designers and engineers. This paper formulates this issue as a typical  constrained optimization  problem firstly by minimizing the cumulative sum of the product of exponential time and the system errors, and a real-time penalty function for overshoots of the system outputs, and then proposes an adaptive population  extremal  optimization-based MPIDNN method called PEO-MPIDNN for the  optimal control  issue of multivariable  nonlinear control systems . The simulation results for two typical multivariable nonlinear control systems have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed PEO-MPIDNN to real-coded  genetic algorithm  (RCGA) and  particle swarm optimization  (PSO)-based MPIDNN, traditional MPIDNN with  back propagation  algorithm, and population extremal optimization-based multivariable  PID control  algorithm in terms of transient-state, steady-state, and robust control performance.",
