    "title": "A Multi Ant System based hybrid heuristic algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problem with Service Time Customization",
    "abstract": "This article introduces an extension of  Vehicle Routing Problem  with Time Window (VRPTW) called Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window Considering Service Time  Customization  (VRPTW-STC). This problem considers total service time as a problem objective. We give out the mathematical model of VRPTW-STC and an ant-based heuristic algorithm to solve it. The algorithm that we apply to this problem is called Multi-Ant System with Local Search (MAS-LS). It combines MAS algorithm with four kinds of local search operators. And, a customer selection heuristic is designed to help find customers that can be added extra service time. Finally, we test performance of MAS-LS on selected Solomon's benchmarks and Homberger's benchmarks. Comparison algorithms include ant-based heuristics, population-based heuristics and  variable neighborhood search  heuristics. Computation experiment results show that MAS-LS has a good and robust performance of finding solutions with lower travelling distance in most tested instances.",
