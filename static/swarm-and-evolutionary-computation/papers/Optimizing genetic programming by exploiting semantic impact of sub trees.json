    "title": "Optimizing genetic programming by exploiting semantic impact of sub trees",
    "abstract": "Now-a-days researchers have diverted their attentions towards making  stochastic algorithms  deterministic. This is to reduce the fruitless exploration during the search process and to give direction to the search process. Lack of  locality  in the algorithms is the biggest hindrance in achieving this goal. Locality in GP is described as the correlation between the change in genotype and the semantics of its phenotype (solution). In strong locality, neighboring genotype and phenotype correspond to each other in a  search space . It is believed that search algorithms exhibiting strong locality perform better than the algorithms with weak locality.  Genetic Programming  is among the best performing stochastic algorithms for solving challenging problems and is cursed with the same problem. This means, a small change in GP tree may result in a huge change in the behavior of the solution and vice versa. Unfortunately, this  stochastic behavior  stops GP from achieving its true potential. 30 years of research since GPâ€™s inception has not solved this problem and even today it is among the biggest challenges faced by the GP community. In this paper we propose a partial derivative based technique for calculating impact of a sub tree on the output of a GP tree. This information is then used to define an  impact aware crossover  operator. This operator reduces  semantic error  of a GP tree by intelligently picking  crossover points  in the tree. Performance of the GP augmented with the new proposed  crossover operator  is compared with the  state of the art techniques . The proposed technique is found efficient, reliable and outperforms the state of the art algorithms on all the tested problems.",
