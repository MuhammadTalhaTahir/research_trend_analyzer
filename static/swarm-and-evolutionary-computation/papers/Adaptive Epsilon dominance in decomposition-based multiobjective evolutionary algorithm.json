    "abstract": "Complicated  geometric shapes  of  Pareto fronts  can cause difficulties for multiobjective  evolutionary algorithms . To deal with these difficulties, efficient diversity strategies must be highly addressed in order to obtain a set of representative  Pareto solutions . In decomposition-based multiobjective  evolutionary algorithms , this is often done by optimizing multiple single objective  subproblems  defined by a set of  weight vectors . For complicated Pareto fronts with extreme convexity, disconnection or degeneracy, however, it is nontrivial to set these weight vector properly. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a new decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on a hybrid weighting strategy, which optimizes both random  subproblems  and fixed subproblems. To maintain diversity of  nondominated solutions  stored in external population, a new archiving strategy based on adaptive Epsilon dominance is also suggested in our proposed algorithm. Our experimental results have showed that our proposed algorithm is superior to several other state-of-the-art multiobjective  evolutionary algorithms  on a set of benchmark multiobjective test problems with different challenging difficulties regarding the geometric shapes of Pareto fronts.",
