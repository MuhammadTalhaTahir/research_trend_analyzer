    "title": "Discovering physics-informed neural networks model for solving partial differential equations through evolutionary computation",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the researches about solving  partial differential equations  (PDEs) based on  artificial neural network  have attracted considerable attention. In these researches, the  neural network  models are usually designed depend on human experience or trial and error. Despite the emergence of several model searching methods, these methods primarily concentrate on optimizing the hyperparameters of fully connected neural network model based on the framework of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and the corresponding  search spaces  are relatively restricted, thereby limiting the exploration of superior models. This article proposes an evolutionary computation method aimed at discovering the PINNs model with higher approximation accuracy and faster convergence rate. In addition to searching the numbers of layers and neurons per hidden layer, this method concurrently explores the optimal shortcut connections between the layers and the novel parametric  activation functions  expressed by the binary  trees . In evolution, the strategy about dynamic  population size  and training epochs (DPSTE) is adopted, which significantly increases the number of models to be explored and facilitates the discovery of models with fast convergence rate. In experiments, the performance of different models that are searched through  Bayesian optimization , random search and evolution is compared in solving Klein–Gordon, Burgers, and Lamé equations. The experimental results affirm that the models discovered by the proposed evolutionary computation method generally exhibit superior approximation accuracy and convergence rate, and these models also show commendable generalization performance with respect to the source term,  initial and boundary conditions , equation coefficient and computational domain.
