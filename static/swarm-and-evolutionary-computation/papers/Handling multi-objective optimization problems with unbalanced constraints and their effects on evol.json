    "title": "Handling multi-objective optimization problems with unbalanced constraints and their effects on evolutionary algorithm performance",
    "abstract": "Despite the successful application of an extension of the Multi-Objective Evolution Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D-M2M) to solve unbalanced multi-objective  optimization problems  (UMOPs), its use in  constrained  unbalanced multi-objective optimization problems has not been fully explored. In an earlier paper, a definition of UMOPs was suggested that had two necessary conditions: 1) finding a favored subset of the  Pareto set  is easier than finding an unfavored subset, and 2) the favored subset of the Pareto set dominates a large part of the feasible space. The second condition strongly reduces the fraction of MOPs that are considered UMOPs. In this paper, we eliminate that second condition and consider a broader class of UMOPs. We design an unbalanced constrained multi-objective test suite with three different types of biased constraints, yielding three different types of constrained test problems in which the degree of imbalance is scalable via a set of parameters introduced for each problem. We analyse the characteristics of three types of constraints and the difficulties they present for potential solution algorithmsâ€“i.e., NSGA-II, MOEA/D and MOEA/D-M2M, with four constraint-handling techniques. MOEA/D-M2M is shown to significantly outperform the other algorithms on these problems due to its decomposition strategy.",
