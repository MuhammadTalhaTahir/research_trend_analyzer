    "title": "Lagrange multiplier-based domain decomposition methods for a non-linear sedimentary basin problem",
    "abstract": "We present two Lagrange multiplier-based domain decomposition methods for solving iteratively a non-linear sedimentary basin problem. Both methods are Uzawa-type algorithms derived from saddle point equations of Lagrangian and augmented Lagrangian functionals. Numerical experiments show that both methods are scalable with respect to the mesh size.",
