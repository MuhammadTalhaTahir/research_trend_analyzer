    "title": "Assessing the accuracy of sequential Gaussian simulation and cosimulation",
    "abstract": "Sequential Gaussian simulation is widespread in Earth Science applications to quantify the uncertainty about regionalized properties. Its practical implementation relies on the screen effect approximation in order to determine the successive conditional distributions by considering only the information available in the neighborhood of the target location. A methodology is presented to assess the accuracy of sequential Gaussian simulation, by calculating the theoretical moments (expectation and variance–covariance matrix) of the simulated random vector and comparing them with the moments of the underlying model. The methodology can be applied in both the conditional and non-conditional contexts, as well as for univariate or multivariate simulation. It is helpful to determine appropriate implementation parameters, in particular about the visiting sequence and the design of the moving neighborhood for selecting relevant conditioning information, prior to performing simulation.",
