    "title": "Analyzing state-dependent model–data comparison in multi-regime systems",
    "abstract": "An approach to analyze regime change in spatial time series datasets is followed and extended to jointly analyze a dynamical model depicting regime shift and observational data informing the same process. We analyze changes in the joint model–data regime and covariability within each regime. The method is applied to two observational datasets of equatorial sea surface temperature (TAO/TRITON array and satellite) and compared with the predicted data by the ECCO-JPL modeling system.",
