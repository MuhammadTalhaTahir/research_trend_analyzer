    "title": "The finite volume method for Richards equation",
    "abstract": "In this paper we prove the convergence of a finite volume scheme for the discretization of an elliptic–parabolic problem, namely Richards equation β(P)t−div(K(β(P))× ∇(P+z))=0, together with Dirichlet boundary conditions and an initial condition. This is done by means of a priori estimates in L2 and the use of Kolmogorov's theorem on relative compactness of subsets of L2.",
