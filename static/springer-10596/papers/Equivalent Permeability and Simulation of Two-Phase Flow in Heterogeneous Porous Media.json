    "title": "Equivalent Permeability and Simulation of Two-Phase Flow in Heterogeneous Porous Media",
    "abstract": "The problem of calculating equivalent grid block permeability tensors for heterogeneous porous media is addressed. The homogenization method used involves solving Darcy's equation subject to linear boundary conditions with flux conservation in subregions of the reservoir and can be readily applied to unstructured grids. The resulting equivalent permeability tensor is stable as defined relative to G-convergence. It is proposed to use both conforming and mixed finite elements to solve the local problems and compute approximations from above and below of the equivalent permeability, respectively. Comparisons with results obtained using periodic, pressure and no-flux boundary conditions and the renormalization method are presented. A series of numerical examples demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology for two-phase flow in heterogeneous reservoirs.",
