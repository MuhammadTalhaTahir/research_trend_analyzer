    "title": "Fluid flow analysis of discrete fracture networks using a locally conservative stable mixed finite element method",
    "abstract": "This paper reports on analyses of fluid exchange between fractures in the simulation of flow through fractured porous media. Flow in the porous media is modeled with traditional Darcy’s equations and the coupling between flow in the porous media and fractures is based on the conceptual Discrete-Fracture-Matrix (DFM) representation, where the fractures are idealized as lower-dimensional elements at the interface of matrix elements. The DFNMesh algorithm is adopted to generate the Finite Element meshes and a novel methodology to handle overlapping fractures in the context of Mixed Finite Element methods is explored. Flux approximation with H(div)-conforming spaces are adopted which are particularly appealing for this analysis because of its inherent properties such as local mass conservation and strong divergence-free enforcement for incompressible flows. The analyses are carried out using simple two-fracture domains and a benchmark problem with eight fractures.",
