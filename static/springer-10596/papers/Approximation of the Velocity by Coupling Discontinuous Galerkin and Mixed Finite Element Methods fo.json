    "title": "Approximation of the Velocity by Coupling Discontinuous Galerkin and Mixed Finite Element Methods for Flow Problems",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we show how to couple the local discontinuous Galerkin method and the Raviart–Thomas mixed finite element method for elliptic equations modeling flow problems. We then show that the approximation of the velocity converges with the optimal order of k when we take the local discontinuous Galerkin that uses polynomials of degree k and the Raviart–Thomas space of polynomials of degree k−1.",
