    "title": "Hysteretic enhancement of carbon dioxide trapping in deep aquifers",
    "abstract": "The sequestration of supercritical carbon dioxide in saline aquifers has been proposed to mitigate global climate change. An important issue is whether it escapes to the atmosphere: chemical retention, for instance, is permanent in well chosen aquifers. The effects of chemical reactions may take time, so one needs short-term containment techniques such as CO2 capillary retention enhanced by permeability hysteresis during water imbibition. This retention is predicted in a class of permeability models for the capillary-dominated regime. Here, we use high-quality laboratory-measured permeabilities as well as exact analytic solutions and accurate simulation techniques to quantify the amount of carbon dioxide that can be trapped. This study on one-dimensional, vertically upward flow demonstrates that under ideal conditions, all of the carbon dioxide is immobilized permanently. This is achieved by a trapping shock due to switching under hysteresis from CO2 to chase-brine injection. This shock is peculiar: it possesses a very small amplitude but a large speed, making it difficult to simulate and detect.",
