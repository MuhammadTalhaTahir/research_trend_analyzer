    "title": "Symmetry and M-Matrix Issues for the O-Method on an Unstructured Grid",
    "abstract": "More sophisticated discretization methods than the traditional control-volume finite-difference methods, have been proposed by Aavatsmark et al. in recent papers for solving the mass balance equations for porous media flow. These methods are based on a local representation of fluxes across cell-edges of control volumes (CVs). This paper will focus on mathematical properties of the discrete operator that arises when an elliptic term of the form −∇⋅(K∇p) is discretized based on these discretization principles.",
