    "title": "Modeling fractures as interfaces with nonmatching grids",
    "abstract": "We consider a model for fluid flow in a porous medium with a fracture. In this model, the fracture is treated as an interface between subdomains, on which specific equations have to be solved. In this article, we analyze the discrete problem, assuming that the fracture mesh and the subdomain meshes are completely independent, but that the geometry of the fracture is respected. We show that despite this nonconformity, first-order convergence is preserved with the lowest-order Raviart–Thomas(-Nedelec) mixed finite elements. Numerical simulations confirm this result.",
