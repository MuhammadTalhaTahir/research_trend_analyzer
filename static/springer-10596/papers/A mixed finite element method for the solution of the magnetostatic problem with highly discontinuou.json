    "title": "A mixed finite element method for the solution of the magnetostatic problem with highly discontinuous coefficients in 3D",
    "abstract": "This paper present a new a mixed finite element method for the simulation of magnetostatic problems with highly discontinuous permeability. The method is derived from the well studied mixed formulation for the div-grad system that is known to be accurate for very large discontinuities. The method robustness is demonstrated on a test model problem.",
