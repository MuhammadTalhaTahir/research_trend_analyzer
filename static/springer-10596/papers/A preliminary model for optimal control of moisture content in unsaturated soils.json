    "title": "A preliminary model for optimal control of moisture content in unsaturated soils",
    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce an optimal control approach to Richardsâ€™ equation in an irrigation framework, aimed at minimizing water consumption while maximizing root water uptake. We first describe the physics of the nonlinear model under consideration, and then develop the first-order necessary optimality conditions of the associated boundary control problem. We show that our model provides a promising framework to support optimized irrigation strategies, thus facing water scarcity in irrigation. The characterization of the optimal control in terms of a suitable relation with the adjoint state of the optimality conditions is then used to develop numerical simulations on different hydrological settings, that support the analytical findings of the paper.",
