    "title": "Near-optimal energy-efficient partial-duplication task mapping of real-time parallel applications",
    "abstract": "Minimizing energy consumption, as well as meeting real-time and reliability constraints, are major goals during system deployment. When complex platforms, such as multicore architectures with  DVFS , and parallel applications are considered, these goals are significantly impacted by task mapping. To minimize energy consumption, while meeting real-time and reliability constraints, this work proposes a task mapping approach to jointly solve the problem of task allocation,  task scheduling , frequency assignment, and task duplication. A novel  heuristic algorithm  is proposed to cope with this NP-hard problem, consisting of a pruning phase, which maintains only the  task configurations  that satisfy reliability constraints, and a mapping phase, which minimizes  total energy consumption  under real-time and precedence constraints. The obtained results show that the proposed heuristic obtains near-optimal results, with low  computation time , compared to optimal solvers, while it achieves better energy consumption and finds slightly more solutions compared to other heuristic approaches.",
