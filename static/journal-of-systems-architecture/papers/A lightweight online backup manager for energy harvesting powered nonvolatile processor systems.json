    "title": "A lightweight online backup manager for energy harvesting powered nonvolatile processor systems",
    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of battery-free and energy-harvesting devices, the  energy harvesting  powered system has gained more attentions and been widely used in different fields. However, unstable harvested energy is a challenge of energy-harvesting devices since the program execution would be interrupted frequently. Non-volatile processor (NVP) is proposed to back up volatile logics before energy depletion and recover the system status after energy  resumption . This paper takes the challenge of forward progress improvement issue in NVP system and proposes a lightweight online backup strategy which tries to aggressively use energy in capacitor after receiving energy warnings. We also build a flexible and accurate simulation tool for NVP system evaluation. The experimental results show an average of 24.2% and 13.7% improved forward progress compared with instant backup method and the most related work, respectively.",
