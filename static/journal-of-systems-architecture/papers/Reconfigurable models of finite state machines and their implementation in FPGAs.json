    "title": "Reconfigurable models of finite state machines and their implementation in FPGAs",
    "abstract": "This paper examines some models of  finite state machines  (FSMs) that can be implemented in dynamically and statically reconfigurable  FPGAs . They enable circuits for the FSMs to be constructed in such a way that allows their behavior to be modified before and during run-time. This is achieved either by swapping pre-allocated areas on a chip in partially dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs, or by reloading memory-based cells in statically configured FPGAs. The initial behavioral description is presented in the form of hierarchical graph-schemes that can be formally translated to traditional FSM specifications such as state diagrams and  state transition tables . The description supports modularity and a hierarchical structure, both of which are important for modifiable circuits. The results of experiments with software models that permit  reconfigurable systems  to be simulated and verified and with a hardware implementation of a FSM have shown that such reusable circuits require very limited FPGA resources and they can be reprogrammed in much the same way as for software development.",
