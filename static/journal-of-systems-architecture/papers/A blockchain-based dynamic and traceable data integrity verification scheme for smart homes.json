    "title": "A blockchain-based dynamic and traceable data integrity verification scheme for smart homes",
    "abstract": "A  smart home system  composed of numerous  smart devices  has benefited peopleâ€™s life due to the feature of convenience. With the development of  smart home  technology, huge amounts of data stored on  external servers  flow between different smart devices, and the integrity of these data is of great importance to the security of smart home systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based data  integrity verification  scheme that supports efficient dynamic operations for a smart home system. In the verification scheme, we utilize the  home gateway  (HG) to aggregate all the data information and design a  data structure  that can be efficiently and dynamically operated to store the tag information of the data, which can reduce the local storage pressure in smart home systems. Moreover, homomorphic verifiable tags are used to formulate verification strategies and record the interactions between HG,  cloud service providers  (CSP), and third-party auditor (TPA) on the  blockchain  to make the  verification service  traceable and useful. Then, the theoretical analysis and experiments prove that the scheme is effective and cost-acceptable in smart home systems.",
