    "title": "Accelerating data filtering for database using FPGA",
    "abstract": "In the  big data  era, in order to relieve computational pressure on overloaded CPU caused by ever increasing amount of data, many researches focus on  hardware acceleration  using  FPGA  for data-intensive applications. In this paper, a novel FPGA-based storage engine is proposed for  DBMS  in the cloud with focus on data filtering operation. A hardware data filter is designed which can significantly speedup filtering operations by utilizing  parallelism  provided by FPGA. Meanwhile, it can support different queries without  partial reconfiguration . This FPGA-based storage engine is integrated with DBMS to realize end-to-end acceleration. In addition, an intelligent filtering on/off switch is designed to adaptively decide whether the FPGA-based filter should be employed, based on  selectivity  estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed solution realizes on average 2.80x computation speedup for data filtering compared with the software baseline, and achieves up to 1.95x improvement in end-to-end evaluation compared with conventional storage engine in low-selectivity cases. Moreover, the FPGA-based solution achieves 2.87x improvement on energy efficiency compared with the similar GPU-based acceleration solution.",
