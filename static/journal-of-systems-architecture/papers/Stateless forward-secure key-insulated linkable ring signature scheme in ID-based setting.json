    "title": "Stateless forward-secure key-insulated linkable ring signature scheme in ID-based setting",
    "abstract": "Forward-security and key-insulation have been the mainstream antidotes to the key exposure problem in conventional and  ring signatures  primarily in the setting of  public key infrastructure . However, all extant schemes require keeping state of time periods. Moreover, time-bound keys are stored for retrieval during key update and more importantly signature-related dispute resolution which may extend beyond stipulated time periods. Spurred on by the gravity of key exposure in the setting of identity-based cryptography, we introduce a stateless forward-secure key-insulated linkable ring signature accomplished partly with  on-demand  ephemeral secret keys consequently eliminating the need for state-keeping and long-term storage. We prove security of our construction in the  Random Oracle Model  based on intractable problems of Computational Diffieâ€“Hellman (CDH) and  Discrete Logarithm  (DL). Subsequently, we present evaluation results from a comparative analysis of extant identity-based linkable ring signature schemes to attest to the uniqueness, convenience and efficiency of our scheme which incidentally compared to state-of-the-art achieves a running time of  22 . 113 m s  faster at  verification phase  making it the fastest compared to extant schemes aside the statelessness and constant linkability attributes.",
