    "title": "A survey on fault-tolerant application mapping techniques for Network-on-Chip",
    "abstract": "Reliability is becoming a major concern in Networks-on-Chips (NoCs) design. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature to deal with different types of faults at different levels of a NoC. This paper surveys the work performed on fault-tolerant mapping techniques in NoCs. A classification is proposed, based on the approaches adopted to recover from failures. Techniques based on the combination of mapping and routing, techniques based on redundancy, and techniques based on task remapping are the main categories of the classification proposed. Furthermore, performance comparison among the listed techniques is provided to highlight the differences. A discussion of the proposed techniques is also performed for each category, leading to some open issues.",
