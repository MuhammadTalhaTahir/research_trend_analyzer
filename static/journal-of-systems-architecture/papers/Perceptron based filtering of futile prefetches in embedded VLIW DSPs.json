    "title": "Perceptron based filtering of futile prefetches in embedded VLIW DSPs",
    "abstract": "Prefetching  has been widely used in  general purpose computers , especially in high performance CPUs, but has been much less used in  DSPs  and embedded processors. The goal of this paper is to investigate adding a  perceptron , a single layer  neural network  [1], to straight-forward hardware prefetching techniques for embedded DSPs, and assess their  performance improvement . By using industry standard benchmarks we come to the conclusion that the use of a  perceptron  to improve the  prefetch  decision making significantly reduces the number of accesses from external memory via shared buses without any significant performance impact. We show that using a perceptron in addition to a prefetch mechanism results in a reduction of 70% on average in the number of accesses to external memory relative to accesses performed using the prefetch mechanism alone. The bandwidth reduction is achieved without any significant  performance loss .",
