    "title": "Schedulability Performance Improvement via Task Split in Real-Time Systems",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on splitting a task into multiple sub-tasks to improve schedulability performance for a set of tasks subject to timing constraints. Targeting FPS (Fixed Priority Scheduling) as a  scheduling algorithm  and RTA (Response Time Analysis) as a  schedulability analysis  on a  multiprocessor  platform, we develop a systematic method to utilize the task split, which addresses (i) how to apply the task split without violating the timing requirement of the original tasks and (ii) how to apply each task so as to make an unschedulable task set to be schedulable. Our simulation results demonstrate that RTA with the method finds 16.1%â€“19.4% (on average) additional task sets that were not proven schedulable by the vanilla RTA.",
