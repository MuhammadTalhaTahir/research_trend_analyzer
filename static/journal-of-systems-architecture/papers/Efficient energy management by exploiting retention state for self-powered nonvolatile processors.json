    "title": "Efficient energy management by exploiting retention state for self-powered nonvolatile processors",
    "abstract": "Energy harvesting  instead of  battery  is a better power source for  wearable devices  due to many advantages such as long operation time without maintenance and comfort to users. However, harvested energy is naturally unstable and program execution will be interrupted frequently. To solve this problem,  nonvolatile  processor (NVP) has been proposed because it can back up volatile state before the  system energy  is depleted. However, this backup process also introduces non-negligible energy and area overhead. To improve the performance of NVP, retention state has been proposed recently which can enable a system to retain the volatile data to wait for power  resumption  instead of saving data immediately. The goal of this paper is to forward program execution as much as possible by exploiting retention state. Specifically, two objectives are achieved. The first objective is to minimize power failures of the system if there is a great probability to get power resumption during retention state. The second objective of this paper is to achieve maximum computation efficiency if it is unlikely to avoid power failure. Compared to the instant backup scheme, evaluation results report that power failure can be reduced by 81.6% and computation efficiency can be increased by 2.5x by the proposed retention state-aware  energy management  strategy.",
