    "title": "Systematic detection of memory related performance bottlenecks in GPGPU programs",
    "abstract": "Graphics processing units  (GPUs) pose an attractive choice for designing high-performance and energy-efficient software systems. This is because GPUs are capable of executing massively parallel applications. However, the performance of GPUs is limited by the contention in  memory subsystems , often resulting in substantial delays and effectively reducing the  parallelism . In this paper, we propose GRAB, an automated  debugger  to aid the development of efficient GPU kernels. GRAB systematically detects, classifies and discovers the root causes of memory-performance bottlenecks in GPUs. We have implemented GRAB and evaluated it with several open-source GPU kernels, including two real-life  case studies . We show the usage of GRAB through improvement of GPU kernels on a  real NVIDIA Tegra K1 hardware  â€“ a widely used GPU for mobile and handheld devices. The guidance obtained from GRAB leads to an overall improvement of up to 64%.",
