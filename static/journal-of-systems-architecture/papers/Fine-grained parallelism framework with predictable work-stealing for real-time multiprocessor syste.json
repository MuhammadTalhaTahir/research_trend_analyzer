    "title": "Fine-grained parallelism framework with predictable work-stealing for real-time multiprocessor systems",
    "abstract": "Lately, parallel task models have received much attention in the development of real-time  multiprocessor systems , as they allow highly compute-intensive tasks to have shorter deadlines which is very much required in modern reactive systems. However, missing modularity and portability can make parallel programming a cumbersome endeavor. As a consequence, compute-intensive sectors in the desktop and server segment have relied on  parallelism  frameworks such as Intel Threading  Building Blocks , Cilk and OpenMP. These  parallelism  frameworks, however, are optimized for decent average case performance and consequently, do not meet the strict requirements imposed by real-time systems. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept parallelism framework which was implemented in particular for soft real-time systems and having tight timing and safety requirements of such  critical systems  in mind. The proposed  runtime system  implements  static memory  allocation in a work-stealing environment that conforms to the strict space and tight probabilistic time bounds of work-stealing schedulers. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of this framework by conducting multiprogrammed benchmarks on a real-time embedded multicore architecture.",
