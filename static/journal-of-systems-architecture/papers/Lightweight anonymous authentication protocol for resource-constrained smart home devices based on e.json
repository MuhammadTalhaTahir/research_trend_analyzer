    "title": "Lightweight anonymous authentication protocol for resource-constrained smart home devices based on elliptic curve cryptography",
    "abstract": "The communication channel between the  smart home devices  and the remote users is susceptible to numerous privacy and security compromise attacks. To address these issues, many  authentication protocols  have been developed. However, majority of these security schemes have vulnerabilities that may still be exploited to wreck havoc in smart homes. For instance, protocols based on low entropy passwords can be broken by  polynomial time  adversaries. Apart from security and privacy challenges, efficiency of the entire  authentication process  is another challenge that needs to be solved. To this end, most of the conventional smart home authentication protocols incur extensive storage, computation as well as  communication overheads  which are unsuitable for resource limited smart home devices. In this paper, an anonymous lightweight protocol is developed, based on one-way hashing and  elliptic curve   point multiplication  operations.  Formal verification  of this protocol is executed using ProVerif while its informal security analysis demonstrates its robustness against majority of the smart home privacy and security attacks. In terms of operational efficiency, comparative analysis is carried out which shows that it incurs relatively low computation, storage and communication overheads.",
