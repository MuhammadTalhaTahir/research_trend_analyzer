    "title": "A flexible attribute based data access management scheme for sensor-cloud system",
    "abstract": "Sensor-cloud combines the merits of  WSN  with  cloud computing  and has been deployed in many practical applications.  Data security  is the prerequisite for the implementation of a sensor-cloud system, but conventional security mechanisms cannot fully satisfy the several new  security demands  arisen in this scenario. To address the challenge of flexible and secure data sharing, in this paper, we design an attribute based data access management scheme for sensor-cloud (ABDM-SC). We take the advantages of attribute based cryptography and hash proof primitive to realize fine-grained  access control  and efficient  user authentication . The data captured by the sensors are labeled by attributes and can only be accessed by users processing the valid credentials. During the data sharing procedure, the cloud side and user side only need to conduct one round of interaction. By security proof and performance evaluation, our ABDM-SC is equipped with high  security level  and satisfactory efficiency.",
