    "title": "Auto-tuning for GPGPU applications using performance and energy model",
    "abstract": "The general-purpose  graphic processing unit  (GPGPU) is a popular accelerator for general applications such as  scientific computing  because the applications are massively parallel and the significant power of  parallel computing  inheriting from GPUs. However, distributing workload among the large number of cores as the  execution configuration  in a GPGPU is currently still a manual trial-and-error process. Programmers try out manually some configurations and might settle for a sub-optimal one leading to poor performance and/or high  power consumption . This paper presents an auto-tuning approach for GPGPU applications with the performance and power models. First, a model-based analytic approach for estimating performance and power consumption of kernels is proposed. Second, an auto-tuning framework is proposed for automatically obtaining a near-optimal configuration for a kernel computation. In this work, we formulated that automatically finding an optimal configuration as the  constraint optimization  and solved it using either simulated annealing (SA) or genetic algorithm (GA). Experiment results show that the fidelity of the proposed models for performance and energy consumption are 0.86 and 0.89, respectively. Further, the  optimization algorithms  result in a normalized  optimality  offset of 0.94% and 0.79% for SA and GA, respectively.",
