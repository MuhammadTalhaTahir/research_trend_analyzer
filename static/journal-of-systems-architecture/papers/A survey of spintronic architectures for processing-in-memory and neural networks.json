    "title": "A survey of spintronic architectures for processing-in-memory and neural networks",
    "abstract": "The rising overheads of data-movement and limitations of general-purpose processing architectures have led to a huge surge in the interest in “processing-in-memory” (PIM) approach and “neural networks” (NN) architectures.  Spintronic  memories facilitate  efficient implementation  of PIM approach and  NN  accelerators, and offer several advantages over conventional memories. In this paper, we present a survey of spintronic-architectures for PIM and NNs. We organize the works based on main attributes to underscore their similarities and differences. This paper will be useful for researchers in the area of  artificial intelligence , hardware architecture, chip design and memory system.",
