    "title": "A Survey on optimized implementation of deep learning models on the NVIDIA Jetson platform",
    "abstract": "Design of  hardware accelerators  for neural network (NN) applications involves walking a tight rope amidst the constraints of low-power, high accuracy and throughput. NVIDIA’s Jetson is a promising platform for embedded  machine learning  which seeks to achieve a balance between the above objectives. In this paper, we provide a survey of works that evaluate and optimize  neural network applications  on Jetson platform. We review both hardware and algorithmic optimizations performed for running  NN algorithms  on Jetson and show the real-life applications where these algorithms have been applied. We also review the works that compare Jetson with similar platforms. While the survey focuses on Jetson as an exemplar embedded system, many of the ideas and optimizations will apply just as well to existing and future embedded systems. It is widely believed that the ability to run  AI  algorithms on low-cost, low-power platforms will be crucial for achieving the “AI for all” vision. This survey seeks to provide a glimpse of the recent progress towards that goal.",
