    "title": "Energy-aware fault-tolerant scheduling for imprecise mixed-criticality systems with semi-clairvoyance",
    "abstract": "Integrating tasks with different functions and  criticality  levels onto the same hardware platform forms mixed-criticality systems (MCSs). Semi-clairvoyant scheduling, in which the mode transition is revealed at the arrival of high-criticality tasks, has attracted researchersâ€™ attention. Most studies focus on the  schedulability test  of MCS and do not consider energy consumption. In this paper, we simultaneously consider  fault tolerance ,  energy management , and semi-clairvoyant scheduling in MCS. Firstly, we propose a schedulability test based on compensating adaptive mixed-criticality called CAMC-sem-cp. Secondly, we propose an energy-efficient  scheduling algorithm  based on the CAMC-sem-cp, called EE-CAMC-sem-cp. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The experimental results show that EE-CAMC-sem-cp can save 47.84% of the energy consumption compared to CAMC-sem-cp.",
