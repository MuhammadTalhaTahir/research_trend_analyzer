    "title": "A recursive method for synthesizing quantum/reversible quaternary parallel adder/subtractor with look-ahead carry",
    "abstract": "Multiple-valued  quantum logic  circuits are a promising choice for future  quantum computing  technology since they have several advantages over binary quantum logic circuits. Adder/subtractor is the major component of the ALU of a computer and is also used in quantum oracles. In this paper, we propose a recursive method of hand synthesis of reversible quaternary full-adder circuit using macro-level quaternary controlled gates built on the top of ion-trap realizable 1-qudit  quantum gates  and 2-qudit Muthukrishnanâ€“Stroud quantum gates. Based on this quaternary full-adder circuit we propose a reversible circuit realizing quaternary parallel adder/subtractor with look-ahead carry. We also show the way of adapting the quaternary parallel adder/subtractor circuit to an encoded binary parallel adder/subtractor circuit by grouping two  qubits  together into quaternary qudit values.",
