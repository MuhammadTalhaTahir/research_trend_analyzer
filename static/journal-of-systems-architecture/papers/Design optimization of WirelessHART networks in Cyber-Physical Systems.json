    "title": "Design optimization of WirelessHART networks in Cyber-Physical Systems",
    "abstract": "Recently, more and more factories begin to employ  wireless mesh networks  for process control. The high dynamics of wireless mesh network leads to a tight interaction between control performance and communication reliability. As a result, these wireless Cyber-Physical Systems need a holistic co-design approach to integrate the cyber space and  physical space . In this paper, we establish a regulation of co-design strategies for wireless Cyber-Physical Systems. We also propose a  heuristic algorithm  to seek the feasible values of co-design parameters in the huge design space. A  testbed  is deployed for exploration and evaluation in industrial environment. The results show that our proposed co-design method provides an approach to enhance communication reliability and control performance even under harsh industrial environment.",
