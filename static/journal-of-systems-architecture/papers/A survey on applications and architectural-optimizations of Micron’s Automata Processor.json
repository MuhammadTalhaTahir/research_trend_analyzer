    "title": "A survey on applications and architectural-optimizations of Micron’s Automata Processor",
    "abstract": "Problems from a wide variety of application domains can be modeled as “nondeterministic finite automaton” (NFA) and hence, efficient execution of NFAs can improve the performance of several key applications. However, traditional architectures, such as CPU and  GPU  are not inherently suited for executing NFAs, and hence, special-purpose architectures are required for accelerating them. Micron’s  automata  processor (AP) exploits massively parallel in-memory processing capability of DRAM for executing NFAs and hence, it can provide orders of magnitude  performance improvement  compared to traditional architectures. In this paper, we present a survey of techniques that propose architectural optimizations to AP and use it for accelerating problems from various application domains. This paper will be useful not only for computer architects and processor-designers, but also for researchers in the field of bioinformatics, data-mining,  machine learning  and others.",
