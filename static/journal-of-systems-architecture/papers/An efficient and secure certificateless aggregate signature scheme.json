    "title": "An efficient and secure certificateless aggregate signature scheme",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the  Internet of Things  (IoT) has been developing rapidly and popularizing the world. Smart home is one of its important applications, the devices and household appliances are connected together through the network to provide intelligent services. However, malicious attacks often occur during the transmission of data information, resulting in data leakage or data changes. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the integrity and availability of data. Based on this, we propose a new pairing-free certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme, which achieves efficient authentication of multiple messages and improves the verification rate. In addition, we demonstrate its security based on the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem in the random oracle model. Comparison with other CLAS schemes proves that our scheme has better security and higher efficiency through performance analysis.",
