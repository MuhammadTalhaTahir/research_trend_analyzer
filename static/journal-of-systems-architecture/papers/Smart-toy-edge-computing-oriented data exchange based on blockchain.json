    "title": "Smart-toy-edge-computing-oriented data exchange based on blockchain",
    "abstract": "Smart toy is a specific  IoT  (Internet of Things) device, and its market demand is growing dramatically. Combined with  edge computing  technology, smart toy can generate valuable data. Smart toy data exchange is a new powerful area. However, there is no efficient, secure and reliable data exchange mechanism among isolated smart toy data platforms and other IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a smart-toy-edge-computing-oriented data exchange prototype using Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. We target to solve the issue of automatically maintaining a tamper-resistant, reliable and  distributed ledger  by writing  smart contract  in the environment where the participants are distrustful of each other. This prototype can simplify the process, save resources and ensure a fair solution of dispute. This method also facilitates the implementation of P2P data exchange among the isolated smart toy and other IoT systems.",
