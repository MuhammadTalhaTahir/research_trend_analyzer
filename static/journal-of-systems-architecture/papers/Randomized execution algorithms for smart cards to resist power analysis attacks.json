    "title": "Randomized execution algorithms for smart cards to resist power analysis attacks",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the applications of smart cards become wider and wider. Smart cards are used in various areas and play a vital role in many security systems. At the same time, the security issue of smart cards has been more and more important. Smart cards are vulnerable to several attack approaches such as power analysis attacks. In this paper, we propose four novel algorithms to defend against power analysis attacks via randomized execution of programs. The experimental results confirm that the new approaches can even the  power distribution of  applications in smart cards, which makes smart cards less susceptible to power analysis attacks. Our approaches are general and not limited to a certain application.",
