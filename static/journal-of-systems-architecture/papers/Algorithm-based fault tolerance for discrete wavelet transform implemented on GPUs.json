    "title": "Algorithm-based fault tolerance for discrete wavelet transform implemented on GPUs",
    "abstract": "An important application for discrete  wavelet transform  (DWT) is the  image compression  such as the  JPEG2000  Standard, and  GPU  is a good choice for the implementation of the DWT. For the application of image compression in the space environment, this paper has discussed the  fault tolerance  for the forward DWT (FDWT) implemented on GPUs, to deal with the silent data corruption (SDC) errors caused by  single event upsets  (SEUs). This paper has analyzed the matrix descriptions for the procedures of the forward DWT in the JPEG2000 Standard. Using the matrix descriptions, the propagation of SDC errors in the multi-level forward DWT has been analyzed, and an algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) method has been proposed, in addition, by analyzing the relationship between the  data type  and the SDC errors, an on-line fast  error detection  and correction method has been proposed to suppress the propagation of the logical value overflow errors. Finally, the performance of the program with ABFT has been evaluated and the overhead of memory space caused by the checksum data has been further analyzed.",
