    "title": "Binary convolutional neural network acceleration framework for rapid system prototyping",
    "abstract": "The huge model size and high  computational complexity  make emerging convolutional  neural network  (CNN) models unsuitable to deploy on current embedded or  edge computing  devices. Recently the binary  neural network  (BNN) is explored to help reduce network model size and avoid complex multiplication. In this paper, a  binary network  acceleration framework for rapid system prototyping is proposed to promote the deployment of CNNs on embedded devices. Firstly trainable  scaling factors  are adopted in binary network training to improve network accuracy performance. The hardware/software co-design framework supports various compact network structures such as residual block, 1 × 1 squeeze  convolution layer , and  depthwise separable convolution . With flexible network  binarization  and efficient hardware architecture optimization, the acceleration system is able to achieve over 2 TOPS throughput performance comparable to modern desktop  GPU  with much higher power efficiency.",
