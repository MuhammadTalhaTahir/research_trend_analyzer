    "title": "Parallel compressive sampling matching pursuit algorithm for compressed sensing signal reconstruction with OpenCL",
    "abstract": "Compressive sensing  (CS) is a new signal  processing method , which was developed recent years. CS can sample signals with a frequency far below the  Nyquist frequency . CS can also compress the signals while sampling, which can reduce the usage of resources for  signal transmission  and storage. However, the  reconstruction algorithm  used in the corresponding decoder is highly complex and computationally expensive. Thus, in some specific applications, e.g.,  remote sensing   image processing  for disaster monitoring, the  CS algorithm  usually cannot satisfy the time requirements on traditional computing platforms. Various studies have shown that many-core computing platforms such as OpenCL are among the most promising platforms that are available for real-time processing because of their powerful floating-point computing capabilities. In this study, we present the design and implementation of parallel  compressive sampling   matching pursuit  (CoSaMP), which is an OpenCL-based parallel CS reconstruction algorithm, as well as some  optimization strategies , such as access efficiency, numerical merge, and instruction optimization. Based on experiments using remote sensing images with different sizes, we demonstrated that the proposed parallel algorithm can achieve speedups of about 41 times and 58 times on AMD HD7350 and NVIDIA K20Xm platforms, respectively, without modifying the application code.",
