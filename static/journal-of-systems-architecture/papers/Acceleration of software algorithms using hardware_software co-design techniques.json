    "title": "Acceleration of software algorithms using hardware/software co-design techniques",
    "abstract": "Currently there is significant interest in the design and implementation of embedded systems where the hardware and software subsystems are developed concurrently in order to meet design constraints. We present a development environment for general-purpose systems, where the objective is to accelerate the performance of software-based applications, which are specified by C programs. Such programs may be partitioned into hardware and software subsystems â€” a speed-critical region of the software is implemented in an FPGA in order to provide the performance acceleration. We also discuss two versions of the underlying system hardware architecture. Practical examples are given to illustrate our approach.",
