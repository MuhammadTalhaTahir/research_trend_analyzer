    "title": "A High-Speed Integrated building emulation engine based on discrete event simulation",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes and validates a software system enabling the  virtualization  of infrustructure in  intelligent buildings . This emulation engine, based on  Discrete Event Simulation , integrates transparently the virtual entities into the existing  management systems  and physical components. It allows the  building management systems  to be completely agnostic to the virtual nature of the emulated components. Additionally, its design permits a highly optimized, concurrent emulation of hundreds of building elements (e.g., loads,  batteries , generators, sensors, actuators, users, etc.) in commodity hardware. The modularity of the core ensures a scalable architecture, both in terms of the type of emulated models and their number. In turn, the decoupled execution of models enables the coexistence of both complex and simplified ones. Candidate applications include the financial and energy analysis of the potential technology investment, high-speed simulation tools for the evaluation and development of  energy management  algorithms (without prior infrastructure investment), and finally, support of occupant-oriented studies on potential  energy savings .",
