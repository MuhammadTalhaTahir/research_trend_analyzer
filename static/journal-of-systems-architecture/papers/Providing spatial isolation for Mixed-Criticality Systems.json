    "title": "Providing spatial isolation for Mixed-Criticality Systems",
    "abstract": "Hard real-time systems, characterized by stringent timeliness requirements, occur in an increasing variety of industrial sectors. Some such domains carry important safety-critical concerns, notably avionics, space, and automotive. One common design trend across those domains seeks to reduce the number of computing devices embedded in them by integrating software applications of different criticality levels into one and the same onboard computer. A safety-savvy design approach however requires isolation among components of different criticality, to prevent unintended reciprocal interference across them. Isolation is traditionally achieved through partitioning. Partitioning, however, incurs low resource utilization as cautionary margins are used to inflate partition budgets over their anticipated needs. This situation has prompted research into alternative ways to integration that can safely afford higher levels of utilization. The Mixed-Criticality (MC) approach, which concentrates on the CPU scheduling problem, has yielded a large body of research results that show considerable gains in sustained utilization, but it has yet to meet all of the isolation requirements of safety-critical systems. This work presents a solution to augment a state-of-the-art MC solution with efficient and effective spatial isolation capabilities. Experimental results show that our solution provides adequate guarantees of temporal  and  spatial isolation with very small runtime overhead.",
