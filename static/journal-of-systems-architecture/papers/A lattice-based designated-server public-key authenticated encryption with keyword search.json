    "title": "A lattice-based designated-server public-key authenticated encryption with keyword search",
    "abstract": "Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) provides an efficient way to search on encrypted cloud data. However, it cannot resist against off-line Inside Keyword Guessing Attacks (IKGA). To alleviate this issue, Huang and Li proposed the Public-key Authenticated Encryption with Keyword Search (PAEKS), which the keyword is also authenticated. However, they do not provide post-quantum security promises. In this paper, we propose the first lattice-based designated-server PAEKS (dPAEKS). We formally define dPAEKS and its security models, and propose a lattice-based construction. It is quantum-resistant under the assumption of learning with errors and the sender authenticated the keyword so it can resist IKGA. Furthermore, we strengthen the security requirement, so that only the designated tester can search the ciphertext. Finally, we compare our scheme with some related schemes to demonstrate its efficiency.",
