    "title": "Computing exact WCRT for typed DAG tasks on heterogeneous multi-core processors",
    "abstract": "Heterogeneous multi-core architectures achieve high performance and energy efficiency in real-time domain towards various applications. Most real-time parallel applications on heterogeneous multi-cores can be modeled as a typed directed acyclic graph (DAG) task, where the workload of each vertex is only allowed to execute on a particular type of core. Traditional worst-case  response time  (WCRT) analysis methods for these applications modeled as DAG are very pessimistic and impractical, i.e., there is a big gap between existing WCRT bounds and the exact WCRT. In this paper, we propose a satisfiability modulo theories-based method to exactly analyze the WCRT of the typed DAG task scheduled upon heterogeneous multi-cores. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the precision of the WCRT, and thus, dramatically increase the acceptance rate in the  schedulability analysis .",
