    "title": "Lightweight formalisation of adaptive middleware",
    "abstract": "The development of adaptive middleware systems is still a challenge due to the complexity of dealing with traditional adaptation issues, such as  Why  to adapt?  When  to adapt?  Where  is the need for change?  What  kind of change is needed?  How  is the adaptation performed? The emerging of new technologies (e.g., process mining) and maturation of existing ones (e.g., model checkers) create new opportunities to face those challenges. This paper presents an end-to-end solution for developing adaptive middleware that integrates software architecture concepts, lightweight formalisation and process mining to handle the mentioned challenges. The proposed solution allows developers to build adaptive middleware by working at a high level of abstraction, i.e., at the  architectural level . In this way, it potentially reduces the effort to implement the middleware and reinforces structural, safety and quantitative properties at development time and when the middleware is already in execution.",
