    "title": "A scalable factory backbone for multiple independent time-sensitive networks",
    "abstract": "Convergence of time-sensitive machine control networks as part of the operational technology (OT) with the ubiquitous information technology (IT) networks is an essential requirement for the ongoing  digitalization  of production. In this paper, we review the fundamental differences between both technologies, the challenges to be solved, existing and upcoming solutions like  TSN  and their limitations. Furthermore, we introduce an Ethernet extension for a  backbone network  at factory scale and line rates of 10 â€“ 100Gbit/s. The backbone is intended to carry massive amounts of IT traffic together with the traffic of multiple independent OT networks at the precision of leading-edge field bus technologies in the sub-microsecond range. The backbone remains transparent and does not require changes to the attached OT sub-networks. We prove our claims by prototype measurements, interoperability tests and field trials.",
