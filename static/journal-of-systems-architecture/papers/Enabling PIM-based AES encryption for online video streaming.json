    "title": "Enabling PIM-based AES encryption for online video streaming",
    "abstract": "Encryption of streaming video is becoming critical to the success of commercial enterprise and to consumers alike. To meet copyright and privacy requirements, encrypting video data on-the-fly during transmission is necessary. In this work we employ  Advanced Encryption Standard  (AES) due to its security and flexibility. However, it is compute and memory-intensive. Increasing the number of concurrent streamers only exacerbates the problem. To ameliorate this situation, we propose a Processing-In Memory (PIM) architecture  AESPIM  to offload AES encryption computation to the memory side. Based on our experimental results,  AES performance  can be improved up to 42% with compared with the traditional CPU based implementation by significantly reducing data movement and increased  memory bandwidth . We further study the data-level and user-level  parallelism  of the video streaming environment in our base design AESPIM architecture, and propose an advanced design based on user-level parallelism to achieve additional 34%  performance improvement . Furthermore, we implement a QoS-aware scheduler to solve its potential workload imbalance bottleneck. Based on evaluation results, performance can be further optimized by up to 6% on average.",
