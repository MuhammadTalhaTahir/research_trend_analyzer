    "title": "A security policy hardening framework for Socio-Cyber-Physical Systems",
    "abstract": "Modern systems are heterogeneous inter-operating subsystems of different aspects that can be physical, technical,  cybernetics , and even social like agent operators in smart grids or smart transportations. With the social dimension, we name these systems by Socio-Cyber-Physical Systems ( SCPS ). However, ensuring safety, correctness, and security against attacks that can be either technical or socio-technical based threats is challenging in the presence of components of different aspects. The main difficulty resides on how well security policies are expressed, integrated, and reinforced within a  SCPS ; in addition to how  SCPS  are designed and precisely specified. For a better precision, we rely on formal methods to develop a sound approach that models  SCPS  entities, especially their demeanour and interactions. Further, we formally specify security requirements and policies in  SCPS . For security analysis, we develop an algorithm that automatically reinforces the specified security policies and also checks the validity of the requirements for a  SCPS  model in the presence or absence of attacks. Finally, we validate the approach on a real case scenario of  SCPS  in the presence of social and technical threats.",
