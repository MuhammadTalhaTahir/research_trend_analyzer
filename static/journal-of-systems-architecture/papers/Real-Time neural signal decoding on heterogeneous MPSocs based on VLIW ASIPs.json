    "title": "Real-Time neural signal decoding on heterogeneous MPSocs based on VLIW ASIPs",
    "abstract": "An important research problem, at the basis of the development of embedded systems for  neuroprosthetic  applications, is the development of algorithms and platforms able to extract the patientâ€™s motion intention by decoding the information encoded in neural signals. At the state of the art, no portable and reliable integrated solutions implementing such a decoding task have been identified. To this aim, in this paper, we investigate the possibility of using the  MPSoC  paradigm in this application domain. We perform a  design space exploration  that compares different custom  MPSoC  embedded architectures, implementing two versions of a on-line neural  signal decoding  algorithm, respectively targeting decoding of single and multiple acquisition channels. Each considered design points features a different application configuration, with a specific partitioning and mapping of parallel software tasks, executed on customized VLIW  ASIP  processing cores. Experimental results, obtained by means of FPGA-based prototyping and post-floorplanning power evaluation on a 40nm technology library, assess the performance and hardware-related costs of the considered configurations. The reported power figures demonstrate the usability of the MPSoC paradigm within the processing of bio-electrical signals and show the benefits achievable by the exploitation of the instruction-level  parallelism  within tasks.",
