    "title": "Energy-efficient scheduling of imprecise mixed-criticality real-time tasks based on genetic algorithm",
    "abstract": "Previous work focuses on the problem of energy for Imprecise Mixed-Criticality Systems on  multiprocessor  platforms, which provides degraded services for low criticality tasks in the high criticality mode. However, the proposed solution based on the partitioning heuristic Criticality-Unaware Worst Fit Decreasing method (CU-WFD) may consume more energy. In this paper, we propose a novel partitioning algorithm named EEAA based on the  genetic algorithm  and explore various parameter combinations, aiming to find a task-to-processor assignment method that can further reduce energy consumption with the best parameter combinations. In addition, we conduct experiments to evaluate EEAA and the experimental result shows that EEAA achieves  energy savings  of 12.56% compared to CU-WFD.",
