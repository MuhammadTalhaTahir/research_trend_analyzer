    "title": "Reliability-aware scheduling for reducing system-wide energy consumption for weakly hard real-time systems",
    "abstract": "While energy consumption is the primary concern for the design of real-time embedded systems, reliability and  Quality of Service  (QoS) are becoming increasingly important in the development of todayâ€™s  pervasive computing  systems. In this paper, we present a reliability-aware  energy management  (RAEM) scheme for reducing the energy consumption for weakly hard real-time systems with ( m, k )-constraints, which requires that at least  m  out of any  k  consecutive jobs of a task meet their deadlines. In order to ensure the ( m, k )-constraints while preserving the system reliability, we propose to partition the real-time jobs into mandatory and optional ones as well as to reserve recovery space for mandatory ones in an adaptive way. Moreover, efficient on-line scheduling techniques are proposed to reduce the system-wide energy, which is consumed not only by the processor but also by other peripheral devices at run-time. Through extensive simulations, our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed techniques can significantly outperform the previous research in reducing system-wide energy consumption for weakly hard real-time systems while preserving the system reliability.",
