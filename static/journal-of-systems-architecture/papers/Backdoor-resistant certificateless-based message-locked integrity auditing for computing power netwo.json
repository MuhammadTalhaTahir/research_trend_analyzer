    "title": "Backdoor-resistant certificateless-based message-locked integrity auditing for computing power network",
    "abstract": "With the evolution of 6G technology, the computing power network (CPN), a crucial infrastructure underpinning the future of digital transformation, is being tightly integrated with 6G to jointly foster significant enhancements in network performance. However, the openness of the network and the semi-trusted nature of cloud service providers pose risks to user data, including potential theft and tampering. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel scheme called the backdoor-resistant certificateless message-locked integrity audit (BRCLMIA). This scheme incorporates a cryptographic reverse firewall, offering an efficient and secure approach to auditing CPN data integrity. Our thorough analysis demonstrates that the BRCLMIA scheme effectively safeguards against existential forgery under adaptive message attacks, safeguards against algorithm replacement attacks, and ensures the integrity and authenticity of data transmitted within the CPN. Furthermore, the performance analysis reveals that the BRCLMIA scheme exhibits remarkable communication and computational efficiency while defending against various attacks.",
