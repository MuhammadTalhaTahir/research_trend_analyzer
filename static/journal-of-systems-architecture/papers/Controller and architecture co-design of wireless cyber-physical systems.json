    "title": "Controller and architecture co-design of wireless cyber-physical systems",
    "abstract": "Recently, more and more factories begin to employ  wireless mesh networks  for process control. These wireless Cyber-Physical Systems (WCPSs) need to meet performance requirements. However, the control algorithm and system are usually designed with an isolated design flow, which leads to higher integration, testing and debugging costs and poor  resource utilization . To bridge the gap, we propose a controller and architecture co-design framework based on architecture analysis and design language (AADL). Firstly, we show how to build control and architecture models of WCPSs. Then methods that translates control and architecture models to performance models are proposed. With these models, we can analyze the non-function properties of the system before implementation. Finally, Matlab/Simulink and OSATE are integrated and several plugins are developed to support the realization of this framework. The synthesis of above contributions is a largely automated co-design and analysis process of WCPSs. Comparing with other co-design frameworks, our framework provides better capability, usability, and extensibility. A  case study  shows that our co-design framework achieves better control performance (reducing the  pulp level  variations to 42.3% of the former controller).",
