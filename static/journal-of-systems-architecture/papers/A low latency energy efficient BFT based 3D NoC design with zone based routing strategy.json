    "title": "A low latency energy efficient BFT based 3D NoC design with zone based routing strategy",
    "abstract": "NoC , along with 3D IC technology, successfully addresses communication needs in complex many-core systems today. Major challenges are scalability, network efficiency,  power consumption , and  energy dissipation . Topology along with an efficient routing strategy, can mitigate such issues. This work proposes a scalable 3D BFT based design along with a zone-based routing policy. 12–76% minimum latency improvement has been observed compared to the state-of-the-art across eight different traffic patterns under heavy traffic. An average gain of 22–88% in router power consumption prevents traffic  hot spots  achieving 4–32% throughput improvement.",
