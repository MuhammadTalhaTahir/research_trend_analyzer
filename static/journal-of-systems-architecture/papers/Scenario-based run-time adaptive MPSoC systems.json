    "title": "Scenario-based run-time adaptive MPSoC systems",
    "abstract": "The ever-increasing performance demand of modern embedded applications drives the development of multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) systems in the embedded domain. Todayâ€™s MPSoC-based products increasingly have to deal with multiple  application execution  scenarios which may change dynamically at run time. To improve the  system performance , a state-of-the-art solution is to dynamically adapting the allocation of system resources at run time for each execution scenario based on pre-determined resource schemes that have been optimized at design time. However, such approaches will not work well for MPSoC systems that have a large number of execution scenarios and/or frequent run-time variations in execution scenario behavior. In this work, we therefore propose a scalable run-time self-adaptive framework for MPSoC systems that addresses these problems, thereby considerably improving the  system efficiency .",
