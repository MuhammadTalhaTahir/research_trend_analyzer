    "title": "Adaptive response time control for metadata matching in information dissemination systems",
    "abstract": "Information dissemination  is of increasing importance to our society. Existing work mainly focuses on delivering information from sources to sinks in a timely manner based on established subscriptions, with the assumption that those subscriptions are persistent. However, the bottleneck of many information dissemination systems is actually the  matching process  to continuously reevaluate such subscriptions between numerous sources and numerous sinks, in response to dynamically varying information attributes at runtime. In this paper, we propose an  adaptive control  architecture to meet the  response time  constraints on metadata matching in an example information dissemination system. Our  adaptive controller  features a rigorous design based on well-established control theory for guaranteed control accuracy and  system stability . Furthermore, our  controller can  adapt to changes in the system model without  reconfiguration  and profiling. Empirical results on a physical  testbed  demonstrate that our controller has more accurate control and improved system  quality of service  than both an open-loop solution and a typical  heuristic solution .",
