    "title": "A CP-ABE-based access control scheme with cryptographic reverse firewall for IoV",
    "abstract": "The convergence of AI and internet technologies has sparked significant interest in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, the vast data generated within these systems poses challenges for onboard terminals and secure data sharing. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution combining ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and a cryptographic reverse firewall (CRF) mechanism for IoV. This approach offers several advantages, including offline encryption and outsourced decryption to improve efficiency. The CRF mechanism adds an extra layer of security by re-randomizing vehicle data, protecting sensitive information. While single-attribute authority schemes simplify access control, they are not ideal for IoV environments. Therefore, we introduce a multi-authority scheme to enhance security. Performance analysis demonstrates our schemeâ€™s ability to optimize encryption and decryption while safeguarding vehicle data confidentiality. In summary, our solution improves data management, access control, and security in the IoV, contributing to its safe and efficient development.",
