    "title": "A banked-promotion translation lookaside buffer system",
    "abstract": "We present a simple but high performance  translation lookaside buffer  (TLB) system with  low power consumption  for use in embedded systems. Our TLB structure supports two page sizes dynamically and selectively to achieve high performance with low  hardware cost . To minimize  power consumption , a banked-TLB is constructed by dividing one fully associative (FA) TLB space into two separate FA TLBs. These two structures are integrated to form a banked-promotion (BP) TLB. Promotion overcomes the unbalanced utilization of a banked-TLB by moving adjacent entries out of the primary banks into a separate super-page TLB. Simulation results show that the Energy*Delay product can be reduced by about 99.8%, 19.2%, 24.2%, and 24.4% compared with a FA TLB, a micro-TLB, a banked-TLB, and a victim-TLB respectively. Therefore, the BP TLB offers high performance with  low power consumption  and low hardware cost.",
