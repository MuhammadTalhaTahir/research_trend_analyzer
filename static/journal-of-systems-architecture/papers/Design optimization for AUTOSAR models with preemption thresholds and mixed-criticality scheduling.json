    "title": "Design optimization for AUTOSAR models with preemption thresholds and mixed-criticality scheduling",
    "abstract": "Safety-critical embedded systems are often subject to multiple certification requirements from different  certification authorities , giving rise to the concept of Mixed-Criticality Systems. Preemption Threshold Scheduling (PTS) is an effective technique for reducing stack memory usage by selectively disabling preemption between pairs of tasks. In this paper, we consider the AUTOSAR standard in automotive embedded software development, where each task consists of multiple runnables that are scheduled with static priority and preemption threshold. We address the problems of design synthesis from an AUTOSAR model to minimize stack usage for mixed-criticality systems with preemption threshold scheduling, and present algorithms for schedulability analysis and system stack usage minimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce the system stack usage.",
