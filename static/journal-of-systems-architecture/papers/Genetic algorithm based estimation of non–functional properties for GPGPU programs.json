    "title": "Genetic algorithm based estimation of nonâ€“functional properties for GPGPU programs",
    "abstract": "Non-functional properties, like execution time or memory access information, of programs running on  graphics processing unit  (GPUs) can raise safety and security concerns. For example, understanding the execution time is critical for embedded and real-time applications. To this end, worst-case execution time (WCET) is an important metric to check the real-time constraints imposed on embedded applications. For complex execution platforms, such as GPUs, analysis of WCET imposes great challenges due to the complex characteristics of GPU architecture as well as GPU program semantics. GPUs also have specific memory access behavior. Observing such memory access behavior may reveal  sensitive information  (e.g. a secret key). This, in turn, may be exploited to launch a side-channel attack on the underlying program. In this paper, we propose  GDivAn , a measurement-based analysis framework for investigating the non-functional aspects of GPU programs, specifically, their execution time and side-channel leakage capacity.  GDivAn  is built upon a novel  instantiation  of genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover,  GDivAn  improves the effectiveness of GA using symbolic execution, when possible. Our evaluation with several open-source GPU kernels, including GPU kernels from the OpenSSL and MRTC benchmark suite, reveals the effectiveness of  GDivAn  both in terms of finding WCET and side-channel leakage.",
