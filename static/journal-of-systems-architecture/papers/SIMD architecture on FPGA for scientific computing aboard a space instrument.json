    "title": "SIMD architecture on FPGA for scientific computing aboard a space instrument",
    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a SIMD  multiprocessor  architecture to reach high performance in  floating point operations  by using  FPGA  devices. This architecture is used in an instrument that carries out the scientific analysis aboard the ESA's  Solar Orbiter  mission. We present a programming language and a compiler able to automatize the SIMD  configuration process  by using an initial sequential code. The proposed architecture squeezes the FPGA resources in order to reach the time constraints. The achieved FPGA system improves the ground-based  system performance  based on commercial CPUs regarding time and  power consumption .",
