    "title": "Blockchain-driven authorized data access mechanism for digital healthcare",
    "abstract": "The existing traditional medical  database system  is a centralized system in which data manipulation is easy, privacy is critical, and there is a lack of easy information exchange and adequate data management. Although  blockchain  mechanisms have the potential to use and easily maintained on the distributed medical architecture around the globe to address the bottleneck situation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based authenticated access control framework. We use blockchain technology to defend patients’ rights to licensed medical material distribution systems. The proposed mechanism’s security has been demonstrated against adversary. The analysis of performance and  comparative study  is also performed, which shows that it is a reliable authenticated access control architecture for e-healthcare in terms of efficiency and security.",
