    "title": "A survey of accelerator architectures for 3D convolution neural networks",
    "abstract": "3D convolution  neural networks  (CNNs) have shown excellent  predictive performance  on tasks such as action recognition from videos. Since 3D CNNs have unique characteristics and extremely high compute/memory-overheads, executing them on accelerators designed for 2D CNNs provides sub-optimal performance. To overcome these challenges, researchers have recently proposed architectures for 3D CNNs. In this paper, we present a survey of  hardware accelerators  and hardware-aware algorithmic optimizations for 3D CNNs. We include only those CNNs that perform 3D convolution and not those that perform only 2D convolution on 2D or 3D data. We highlight their key ideas and underscore their similarities and differences. We believe that this survey will spark a great deal of research towards the design of ultra-efficient 3D CNN accelerators of tomorrow.",
