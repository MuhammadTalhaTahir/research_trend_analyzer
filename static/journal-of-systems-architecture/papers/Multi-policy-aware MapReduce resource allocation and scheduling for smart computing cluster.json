    "title": "Multi-policy-aware MapReduce resource allocation and scheduling for smart computing cluster",
    "abstract": "When a user submit a  MapReduce  job in the smart computing cluster, we first need to allocate cluster resource for the job. It is widely concerned that how to save time and resource costs to provide users with computing capacity and services. Here, we propose a multi-policy-aware  Resources Allocation  Algorithm that can allocate the appropriate amount of resources to the job to meet the execution deadline in private cloud and an extension in public cloud. Then when job running in the allocated cluster, in order to guarantee the performance of smart computing framework, we further propose a multi-policy-aware resource scheduling optimization model under YARN. If users use default policy, considering the difference of the heterogeneity of jobs and the resource request of tasks, we propose a global task dynamic resource scheduling algorithm—LRD algorithm, based on  data locality , resource demand and  task dependency . Further, if users set the deadline policy for jobs, we propose a DA (deadline-aware)  scheduling algorithm  based on performance prediction model. It can optimize the overall execution time of  Hadoop  jobs and improve the  resource utilization  of the entire cluster. Finally, we conduct different experiments to evaluate and verify the proposed models and algorithms in this paper.",
