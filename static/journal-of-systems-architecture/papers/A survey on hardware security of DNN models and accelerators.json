    "title": "A survey on hardware security of DNN models and accelerators",
    "abstract": "As “deep neural networks” (DNNs) achieve increasing accuracy, they are getting employed in increasingly diverse applications, including security-critical applications such as medical and defense. This immense use of DNNs has motivated the researchers to scrutinizingly study their  security vulnerability  and propose countermeasures, especially in the context of hardware security. In this paper, we present a survey of techniques for the hardware security of DNNs. For the  research works , we highlight the threat-model, key idea for launching attack and defense strategies. We organize the works on salient categories to highlight their strengths and limitations. This paper aims to equip researchers with the knowledge of recent advances in  DNN security  and motivate them to think of security as the first principle.",
