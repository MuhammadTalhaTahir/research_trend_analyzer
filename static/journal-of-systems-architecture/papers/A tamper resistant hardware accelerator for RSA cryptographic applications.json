    "title": "A tamper resistant hardware accelerator for RSA cryptographic applications",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an  hardware accelerator  which can effectively improve the security and the performance of virtually any RSA  cryptographic application . The accelerator integrates two crucial security- and performance-enhancing facilities: an RSA processor and an RSA key-store. An RSA processor is a dedicated hardware block which executes the  RSA algorithm . An RSA key-store is a dedicated device for securely storing RSA key-pairs. We chose RSA since it is by far the most widely adopted standard in  public key cryptography . We describe the main  functional blocks  of the  hardware accelerator  and their interactions, and comment  architectural solutions  we adopted for maximizing security and performance while minimizing the cost in terms of hardware resources. We then present an FPGA-based implementation of the proposed architecture, which relies on a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) programmable hardware board. Finally, we evaluate the system in terms of performance and chip area occupation, and comment the design trade-offs resulting from different levels of  parallelism .",
