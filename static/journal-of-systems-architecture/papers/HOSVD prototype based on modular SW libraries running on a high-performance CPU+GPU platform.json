    "title": "HOSVD prototype based on modular SW libraries running on a high-performance CPU+GPU platform",
    "abstract": "Efficient prototyping is an invaluable resource for modern enterprises and research centers. An efficient prototyping tool exhibits high throughput while maintaining flexibility, and reduces design and validation efforts, resulting in low time-to-market and high competitiveness. This paper presents a modular implementation of high-performance software (SW) libraries running on a Heterogeneous Computing Platform (HCP) based on CPU+GPU. The proposed SW libraries enable a fast and easy comparison of a prototype under different implementation criteria and maintain a high throughput and  reusability  due to their modular definition. These features accelerate the prototyping task by removing the overhead of designing and validating ad-hoc implementations. The novelty and benefits of this proposal are presented by prototyping and analysis of the  multilinear  SVD  or  Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) , an important, widely-used, and computationally demanding tensor decomposition. The  mean square error  (MSE), processing time, and speedup of this case study show its high performance, while modularity maintains flexibility. The  HOSVD  prototype reaches a maximum speedup of  17 ×  that of one of the most important implementations in the state of the art.",
