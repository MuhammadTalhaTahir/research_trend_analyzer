    "title": "Supporting logical execution time in multi-core POSIX systems",
    "abstract": "Safety-critical  automotive applications  require predictable and deterministic execution to not miss the timing requirements. Logical  Execution Time  (LET) is a paradigm already established in the automotive industry to improve the predictability and correctness of time-critical applications. Despite LET being already part of the  AUTOSAR  Classic standard, no prior work has addressed the design of this model on POSIX-based operating systems, which will be the base of next-generation  automotive Electronic   Control Units  (ECUs). This paper proposes and discusses possible LET design approaches for these novel systems. Different implementations are then evaluated and compared through the WATERS Challenge automotive application running on a multi-core heterogeneous hardware platform.",
