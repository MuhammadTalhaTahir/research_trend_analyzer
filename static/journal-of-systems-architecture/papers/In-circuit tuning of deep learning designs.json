    "title": "In-circuit tuning of deep learning designs",
    "abstract": "This paper presents OTune, a novel overlay-based approach for rapid in-circuit debugging and tuning of  Deep Neural Network  (DNN) designs targeting Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We first propose overlay-based instruments that provide hardware profiling information to FPGA-based DNN developers for tuning and debugging their designs. Our instrumentation is optimized to take advantage of characteristics of the  DNN application  domain and traces useful information for in-circuit domain-specific development. Besides, a light-weight overlay-based DNN processing engine is implemented to support rapid  word length  tuning, which allows adjusting each DNN layerâ€™s  datapath  without time-consuming FPGA compilation. Furthermore, our approach enables tuning of FPGA-based DNN designs for edge systems, which would benefit developing adaptive  learning systems . Evaluation results show that OTune can tune a fixed-point design to the same accuracy as a floating-point one with less than 4% added FPGA area.",
