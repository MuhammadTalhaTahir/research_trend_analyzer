    "title": "High-performance hard-input LDPC decoding on multi-core devices for optical space links",
    "abstract": "LDPC codes  are a family of error-correcting codes that are present in most  space communication  standards. Thanks to their large processing power and their  parallelization  capabilities, prevailing multicore devices facilitate real-time implementations of  digital communication systems , which were previously implemented into dedicated hardware devices. Previous works were done over the last decade on the implementation of Gbps decoders on programmable devices. However, these works focus on the soft input LDPC decoding algorithms. But, hard-input LDPC decoders are also required to design and prototype for instance next optical-based  satellite communication  systems. These systems should provide  high throughput  ( ≥ 10  Gbps) and low latency ( ≤ 1 ms ) internet links. In this article, the first software-based implementation of a hard-input multi-Gbps LDPC decoder is detailed. Thanks to different parallelization strategies and deeply optimized  SIMD  codes, throughput up to 7.5 Gbps is achieved when 10 Gallager-E iterations are executed onto an INTEL Xeon device making possible the design of software  base station  systems providing throughputs of tens of Gbps for optical system evaluation or base station design.",
