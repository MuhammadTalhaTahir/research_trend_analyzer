    "title": "A privilege-constrained sanitizable signature scheme for e-health systems",
    "abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) sharing schemes are widely used in healthcare, medical, and research. However, privacy may be a concern for patients with EHRs. In this paper, a secure EHR sharing scheme with sanitizable signature is proposed to protect patientsâ€™ privacy and enhance accountability. Our proposed scheme makes the following contributions: (1) doctors can specify patients to modify some fields before the expiration time; (2) patients can convert the original signature into a new and unlinkable signature for the modified record without interacting with the doctor; (3) the scheme satisfies traceability and can distinguish the generator of a given signature. In contrast to existing approaches, we introduce a new limited sanitizable signature scheme as the main ingredient, which allows the signer not only to decide which message blocks can be modified, but also to determine the maximum number of modifiable blocks and the expiration time for sanitization. Finally, the security analysis and experimental results show that the security and efficiency of our scheme can be approved.",
