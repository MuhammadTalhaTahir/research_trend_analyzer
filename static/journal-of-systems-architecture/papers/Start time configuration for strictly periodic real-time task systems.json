    "title": "Start time configuration for strictly periodic real-time task systems",
    "abstract": "In many  digital control systems , it is required to perform computation in a strictly periodic fashion to provide high control performance. System designers need to assign time slots that are infinitely repeated given a strict period for each task such that the time slots of different tasks do not overlap. While previous work has studied how to decide if a system is schedulable with a certain time slot assignment, it is still an unexplored area of how to select time slots for strictly periodic tasks to make them schedulable. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to solve the above problem. Our method explores the relations among task periods to improve the possibility of finding feasible start time configurations. Finally, we conduct experiments with randomly generated workload to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",
