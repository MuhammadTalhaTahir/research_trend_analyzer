    "title": "A provably-secure authenticated key agreement protocol for remote patient monitoring IoMT",
    "abstract": "With the continuous improvement of the public medical system, the current medical service industry is more intelligent. The Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) plays a significant role in smart medicine. The emergence of remote wireless monitoring platforms in the IoMT systems has significantly reduced the risk of virus infection among medical staff. However, data may be easily stolen by criminals during the transmission process. We propose a three-factor enhanced protocol to monitor patient body information and mitigate the issues. The proposed protocol can provide the confidentiality of transmitted data and the privacy of doctors and patients. The security of the proposed protocol is demonstrated in the Random Oracle Model (ROM) for computational security. In addition, by comparing the proposed protocol with other related works, our designed protocol has efficient performance both in execution time and communication costs.",
