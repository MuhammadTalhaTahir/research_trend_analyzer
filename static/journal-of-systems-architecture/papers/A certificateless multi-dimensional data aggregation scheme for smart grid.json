    "title": "A certificateless multi-dimensional data aggregation scheme for smart grid",
    "abstract": "In the context of the smart grid, the use of smart meters to regularly collect electricity data from customers poses a significant risk of  privacy disclosure . Furthermore, traditional data aggregation schemes assume a fully trusted authority, neglecting the possibility of malicious trusted third parties and collusive attacks from control centers and gateways, which raises privacy invasion concerns for users. To address this issue, this article proposes a multi-dimensional data aggregation scheme based on certificateless  public key cryptography  for smart grid, which utilizes Paillier homomorphic  encryption system  in a fog computing-based architecture and implements  authentication  and key negotiation among member users. This scheme is designed to resist collusive attacks from control centers (CC) and fog nodes (FNs), while also protecting usersâ€™ privacy even in the face of a malicious key generation center (KGC). Detailed security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme meets the security requirements of the smart grid. Additionally, Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the computational overhead of both smart meters and  aggregators  compared to existing multidimensional data aggregation schemes.",
