    "abstract": "The  Internet of Things  (IoT) is becoming increasingly popular for transmitting massive data in a network. With a limited supply of  IoT devices , utilizing cloud storage is considered to be an optimal way of processing data. Although  cloud computing  provides an efficient means of  data storage  and secure sharing in resource-limited devices, it is still a challenge to enable end users to publish search queries and implement fine-grained access control over a  ciphertext  at the same time. Blockchain-assisted searchable attribute-based encryption (SABE) can achieve  data confidentiality  and fine-grained access control. In our work, we present blockchain-assisted SABE for e-health systems. Our framework not only combines the advantages of attribute-based encryption (ABE) and blockchain technology but also supports hidden policies. A rigorous security proof shows that our scheme can achieve the known security under a chosen keyword attack. An experiment indicates that the proposal is suitable for e-health systems.",
