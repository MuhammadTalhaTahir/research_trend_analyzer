    "title": "Time-constrained scheduling of large pipelined datapaths",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the most crucial  optimization problem  of high-level synthesis: scheduling. A formal framework is described that was tailored specifically for the definition and investigation of the time-constrained scheduling problem of pipelined  datapaths . Theoretical results are presented on the complexity of the problem. Moreover, two new  heuristic algorithms  are introduced. The first one is a  genetic algorithm , which, unlike previous approaches, searches the space of schedulings directly. The second algorithm realizes a  heuristic search  using  constraint logic programming  methods. The performance of the proposed algorithms has been evaluated on a set of benchmarks and compared to previous approaches.",
