    "title": "A priority, power and traffic-aware virtual machine placement of IoT applications in cloud data centers",
    "abstract": "Recent telecommunication paradigms, such as  big data ,  Internet of Things  (IoT), ubiquitous  edge computing  (UEC), and  machine learning , are encountering with a tremendous number of complex applications that require different priorities and resource demands. These applications usually consist of a set of virtual machines (VMs) with some predefined traffic load between them. The efficiency of a cloud  data center  (CDC) as prominent component in UEC significantly depends on the efficiency of its  VM placement  algorithm applied. However, VM placement is an NP-hard problem and thus there exist practically no optimal solution for this problem. In this paper, motivated by this, we propose a priority, power and traffic-aware approach for efficiently solving the VM placement problem in a CDC. Our approach aims to jointly minimize  power consumption , network consumption and resource wastage in a multi-dimensional and heterogeneous CDC. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compared it to the state-of-the-art on a fat-tree topology under various experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of reducing the total network consumption up to 29%, the consumption of power up to 18%, and the wastage of resources up to 68%, compared to the second-best results.",
