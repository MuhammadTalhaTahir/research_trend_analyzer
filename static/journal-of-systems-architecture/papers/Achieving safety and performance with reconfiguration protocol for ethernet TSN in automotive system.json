    "title": "Achieving safety and performance with reconfiguration protocol for ethernet TSN in automotive systems",
    "abstract": "Application of Ethernet-based networks in the autonomous and automated vehicles requires safe and efficient  resource management policy . The network components must not only handle high volume of sensor data but also safely accommodate dynamics in  system behavior , e.g. detect permanent failures, switch between different driving modes (city/highway), incorporate car-2-x communication etc. This is currently manageable only by using static  network configuration , due to the safety concerns, leading to resource overprovisioning under almost all conditions or unfulfilled design requirements. In this work we present an alternative solution which, through protocol-based synchronization and fine-grained re-configuration, allows traffic isolation, fault recovery and controlled adjustments of network performance. This enables cost saving, multi-mode  network functionality  at low overhead as well as new  system functions  and improved  user experience  by dynamic over-the-air network operation. We offer a detailed evaluation of our approach in a demonstrator setup as well as a simulation and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.",
