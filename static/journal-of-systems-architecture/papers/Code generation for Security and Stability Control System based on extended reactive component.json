    "title": "Code generation for Security and Stability Control System based on extended reactive component",
    "abstract": "The Security and Stability Control System (SSCS) is developed to ensure the safe and stable operation of power grids, effectively mitigating  failure propagation  through emergency  control strategies . However, due to the diversity, complexity, and region-specific nature of SSCS, the need for individualized development often arises, leading to time-consuming and error-prone in SSCS development. To address this challenge, we introduce ERC-Code, an automated development framework that empowers developers to prioritize design over implementation. ERC-Code includes extended reactive component modeling, correctness specifications, and model-to-code transformations. The extended reactive component offers the advantage of capturing the complex logic of SSCS at a high level of abstraction, including loops, branches and  synchronizations . The correctness specifications prevent the creation of incomplete and invalid models, ensuring the robustness of the generated code. Additionally, the model-to-code engine automatically generates code from the extended reactive component. Our evaluation covers three key aspects: firstly, we assessed the effectiveness of ERC-Code in three real-world SSCS applications. We then conducted a comparison between the traces generated by ERC-Code and the ERC model. Finally, we conducted an experiment to evaluate developer productivity, drawing comparisons between ERC-Code and a code-centric approach. Our results exhibit promise, affirming ERC-Codeâ€™s applicability and code quality, along with enhanced productivity.",
