    "title": "A blockchain-based fine-grained data sharing scheme for e-healthcare system",
    "abstract": "The cloud-aided sharing of e-healthcare data has great positive significance for research. However, due to the privacy consideration, these data are usually encrypted before uploading to the cloud server which impedes data sharing between different medical institutions. Conditional proxy re-encryption (CPRE) allows the proxy to converse ciphertext, especially by specifying a condition embed in the re-encryption key to achieve fine-grained access control over the ciphertext. Unfortunately, existing CPRE schemes cannot ensure the privacy of the condition, which may contain some sensitive private information. Furthermore, a malicious proxy server may return part of the results and even false data to save its computation or bandwidth. To solve these problems, we propose a blockchain-based condition invisible proxy re-encryption scheme for the e-healthcare system. The proposed scheme guarantees the confidentiality of the data by hiding the condition in the re-encryption key so that the proxy cannot learn anything about the condition. Moreover, the ciphertext-searching algorithm is leveraged by executing the smart contract in the blockchain which ensures the results are correct and complete. Finally, experiment results demonstrate the practicability of the proposed scheme in applications.",
